        "Abstract": "One of the most frequent hereditary causes of thrombophilia is, without a doubt, resistance to Activated Protein C (APC-resistance), which is a consequence of point mutation in gene coding for coagulation Factor V (Factor V Leiden) in 90-95% of cases. The aim of this paper was to determine prevalence of APC-resistance in a group of healthy blood donors. The size of the group is quite representative of Kosovo Albanians. A total of 944 blood donors were examined (537 males and 407 females), for whom APC-resistance was determined by functional methods of coagulation using the kit ACTICLOT(R) Protein C Resistance. Method is based on the test of APTT determined twice: first in the presence and second in the absence of activated Protein C (APC). The ratio of these two values constitutes is called Activated Protein C- Sensitivity Ratio (APC-SR). From 944 examined donors, pathologic values of APC-SR (1,3-1,9) were found in 32 persons (3,4% of the total number). The distribution among sexes was 3,35% (18/537) in male and 3,43% (14/407) in female subjects. The mean values of APC-SR (1,64 in male and 1,71 in female subjects) were not significantly different (P = 0,22). Based on these results, we conclude that the prevalence of APC resistance in Albanian population of Kosovo is within the lower limit of prevalence in general population in different countries of European countries, which, according to some authors ranges is from 3 to 7%."

        "Abstract": "Volume density of respiratory organs was studied in vitro in newborn babies at different age of gestation (abort, immature, premature and mature) using stereometric method. The total of 23 cases was subject to this study. The respiratory organs (trachea, lungs) were taken from autopsies of newborn babies exited from different causes. For this purpose the tissues were fixed in formalin (10%) solution, cut serially in 7micro and 10micro slabs. Volume density of the respiratory system was assessed stereometricaly using Universal testing system Weibel M 42. We observed that volume density of epithelia, musculature and glands were proportionally present in the tracheal tissue. Cellular interstitial tissue is consistently increasing and corresponds to the developmental stages of the newborn babies. The density of tracheal ganglions is greater in premature ages of immature and premature newborns (p<0,05). Decreased number of ganglion cells is observed in mature ages (p<0,05). This is caused by intensive ramification of ganglions from serosa to deeper layers of trachea right to epithelium. Medium diameter of tracheal ganglions is greater in mature newborn babies and corresponds to developmental ages of babies."

        "Abstract": "The role of meconium in the respiratory system was studied in newborns, who died from various causes (250 up to 3000 g of weight). We monitored tracheal rings response to dopamine, serotonin and ethanol in different concentrations (dopamine: 0,05 mg/ml, 0,5 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml; serotonin (5-HT): 10-4, 10-3, 10-2, 10-1 mol/dm3; ethanol: 0,02 ml, 0,5 ml, 1,0 ml; 96%). Tracheal smooth musculature tonus (TSM) was examined in 48 tracheal preparations taken after the newborn exitus due to different reasons. Based on functional researche of isolated preparations of tracheas, it may be concluded that: aspiration of meconium has not changed the response of TSM to dopamine, serotonin and ethanol (p>0,1) in comparison with the control group, which have died due to different lung inflammatory processes (e.g. pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, atelectasis, cerebral hemorrhage). The results suggest that meconium does not potentiate the constricting action of dopamine, serotonin and ethanol in tracheobronchial system. Meconium causes mild relaxation of the TSM through a mechanism that is not intermediated by the products of cyclooxygenases (prostaglandins, prostacyclins) from the tracheal epithelium or proteins. Also, as it seems, the direct activity of many tested acids in the smooth musculature has no significant impact on increase of the airways tonus in MAS syndrome."

The percentage predicted values of forced vital capacity (FVC), volume of air exhaled during first second of FVC (FEV1), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV), actual values of maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures (MIP and MEP in mmHg), and ratios of actual values of FEV1/FVC (%) and FEV1/PEFR (ml/l/min) were analyzed.Results:Compared with controls SCA patients had significant reductions of FVC (71.1 ± 17.5 vs 85.5 ± 18.7; P < 0.01), PEFR (51.5 ± 20.7 vs 77.1 ± 24.9; P < 0.001), MVV (64.4 ± 21.6 vs 97.2 ± 22.7; P < 0.001), MIP (27.7 ± 16.8 vs 50.1 ± 15.1; P < 0.001) and MEP (38.1 ± 18.7 vs 74.7 ± 16.0; P < 0.001), elevation of FEV1/PEFR (10.5 ± 2.8 vs 7.4 ± 2.1; P < 0.001), but no significant change of FEV1 and FEV1/FVC. FEV1/PEFR correlated positively with illness duration and MVV negatively with severity of illness.Conclusions:The present study showed subclinical restrictive type of pulmonary dysfunction in SCA, and possible presence of upper airway obstruction.

In this review paper, the following areas are covered: thrombolysis, stroke unit care, secondary prevention, surgical treatment, and rehabilitation. Additionally, symptoms at stroke onset, as well as outcome measures, such as death, dependency, stroke recurrence, quality of life, and depression are reviewed.Methods:Search in PubMed, tables-of-contents, review articles, and reference lists after studies that include information about sex differences in stroke care.Results:Ninety papers are included in this review. Women suffer more from cortical and non-traditional symptoms. Men and women benefit equally from thrombolysis and stroke unit care. Women with cardioembolic strokes may benefit more from anticoagulant therapy. Most studies have not found any tendency towards sexism in the choice of treatment. Post-stroke depression and low quality-of-life seem to be more common among women. Mortality rates are higher among men in some studies, while long-term ADL-dependency seems to be more common among women.Conclusions:Sex differences in stroke treatment and outcome are small, with no unequivocal proof of sex discrimination. Women have less favourable functional outcome because of higher age at stroke onset and more severe strokes."

We explored the functional roles of these proteins by means of detection of serum anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP antibody) in patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT).Methods:Sera were obtained from 42 patients with DAT, 30 patients with other neurological disorders and 42 healthy controls. Gender ratio and age were comparable among the three groups. The level of anti-CCP antibody in sera was examined by ELISA.Findings:Anti-CCP antibody was not found in the 30 patients with other neurological disorders, and only one of the 42 healthy controls (2.4%) was positive. However, surprisingly, anti-CCP antibody was clearly detected in eight of the 42 DAT patients.Interpretation:Anti-CCP antibody appears to be a simple and early serologic biomarker for DAT among dementia patients. Additionally, our data imply that citrullinated proteins accumulated in the astrocytes of AD patients acquire neo-antigenicity, inducing anti-CCP antibody production."

The study population included 242 children hospitalized between 2001 and 2006 for GBS meningitis (220 in the LOD group and 22 in the ULOD group).Results:Univariate analysis revealed that gestational age (GA) was significantly lower in the ULOD group as compared with the LOD group (respectively 35.6 weeks vs. 37.9 weeks, p = 0.002). Prevalence of early preterm birth (before the 32nd week GA) was significantly higher in the ULOD group than in the LOD group (32% vs. 7%, p = 0.002). No significant difference was found between the two groups for biological characteristics of lumbar puncture, GBS serotypes, complications and survival rate.Conclusion:These data suggest that LOD and ULOD would be the same clinical and bacteriological entity, except for prematurity, which seems significantly associated with ULOD."

Assuming that such an increase is mediated by blocking the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) via ionotropic GABA receptors, we tested the effect of both GABA itself and GABA-receptor antagonists such as (-)bicuculline (1.51-fold increase) and (1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)methylphosphinic acid (TPMPA; 1.46-fold increase) on the b-wave amplitude.Methods:Recording of the transretinal potentials from the isolated bovine retina.Results:GABA (100 microM) reduced the b-wave amplitude only when NiCl(2) (15 microM) was applied first. Each antagonist applied on its own stimulated the b-wave amplitude only partially: subsequent NiCl(2) superfusion caused a small but additional increase, leading to a 1.69- and a 1.88-fold total increase of the amplitude by Ni(2+) plus (-)bicuculline or Ni(2+) plus TPMPA, respectively. Only the application of both antagonists in combination, before superfusing low NiCl(2) (15 microM), completely prevented subsequent stimulation by NiCl(2) with a similar 1.90-fold total increase of b-wave amplitude. Those retina segments that did not respond to NiCl(2) could not be stimulated by (-)bicuculline and vice versa.Conclusion:The stimulatory effect of NiCl(2) on the ERG b-wave amplitude is mainly, but not only, mediated by a NiCl(2)-sensitive, Ca(v)2.3-triggered GABA release acting through ionotropic GABA-A and GABA-C receptors."

To replicate and further explore these findings, we investigated the effects of 12 previously reported candidate genetic variations in two groups of alcohol-dependent European Americans with a history of withdrawal, which differed according to the presence (n = 112) or absence (n = 92) of AWS and/or DT. Associations of AWS and/or DT with the genomic and clinical characteristics and gene-gene interaction effects were investigated using logistic regression models. None of the polymorphisms were significantly associated with AWS/DT after correction for multiple testing. However, we found a significant interaction effect of the SLC6A4 promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) and DRD2 exon 8 single nucleotide polymorphism rs6276 on AWS and/or DT history (P = 0.009), which became more significant after adjustment for lifetime maximum number of drinks consumed per 24 hours (P < 0.001). Subsequent analysis revealed an even stronger association of the SLC6A4-DRD2 interaction with DT (P < 0.0001), which remained significant after Bonferroni correction. Results reveal decreased likelihood of DT in alcoholics that carry the DRD2 rs6276 G allele and SLC6A4 LL genotype. This study provides the first evidence to implicate the interaction between serotonin and dopamine neurotransmission in the etiology of DT. Replication is necessary to verify this potentially important finding."

For this purpose, adolescent rats were repetitively treated during two treatment stages (stage 1: days 1-10; stage 2: days 15, 17, 19) with RS-MDMA (5 or 10 mg/kg) or each of the respective enantiomers (5 mg/kg). The repeated treatment started on postnatal day (PND) 32 and locomotor activity was measured on each day by means of a photobeam-equipped activity box system. RS-MDMA or S-MDMA administration led acutely to massive hyperlocomotion and subchronically, to the development of behavioural sensitization after a short habituation period. R-MDMA was free of hyperactivating effects and even decreased locomotor behaviour upon repeated treatment. Nevertheless, co-administration of R-MDMA increased the hyperactivity of S-MDMA and made the S-MDMA induced behavioural sensitization state-dependent. The animals pre-treated with R-MDMA showed a sensitized response in adulthood when tested with RS-MDMA. Our results indicated that even in the absence of substantial neurotoxicity, both MDMA enantiomers can lead to long-term changes in brain circuitry and concomitant behavioural changes when repeatedly administered in adolescence. The sensitization development was most pronounced in the animals treated with S- and RS-MDMA; the animals with R-MDMA did not develop sensitization under repeated treatment but expressed a sensitized response when challenged with RS-MDMA."

        "Abstract": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is synthesized in brain by two isoforms of glutamic acid decarboxylase (Gad), Gad1 and Gad2. Gad1 provides most of the GABA in brain, but Gad2 can be rapidly activated in times of high GABA demand. Mice lacking Gad2 are viable whereas deletion of Gad1 is lethal. We produced null mutant mice for Gad2 on three different genetic backgrounds: predominantly C57BL/6J and one or two generations of backcrossing to 129S1/SvimJ (129N1, 129N2). We used these mice to determine if actions of alcohol are regulated by synthesis of GABA from this isoform. We also studied behavioral responses to a benzodiazepine (flurazepam) and a GABAA receptor agonist (gabaxadol). Deletion of Gad2 increased ethanol palatability and intake and slightly reduced the severity of ethanol-induced withdrawal, but these effects depended strongly on genetic background. Mutant mice on the 129N2 background showed the above three ethanol behavioral phenotypes, but the C57BL/6J inbred background did not show any of these phenotypes. Effects on ethanol consumption also depended on the test as the mutation did not alter consumption in limited access models. Deletion of Gad2 reduced the effect of flurazepam on motor incoordination and increased the effect of extrasynaptic GABAA receptor agonist gabaxadol without changing the duration of loss of righting reflex produced by these drugs. These results are consistent with earlier proposals that deletion of Gad2 (on 129N2 background) reduces synaptic GABA but also suggest changes in extrasynaptic receptor function."

We studied the respiratory effects of intraperitoneal methadone at 1.5, 5, and 15 mg/kg (corresponding to 80% of the lethal dose-50%) in rats using arterial blood gases and plethysmography. OR antagonists, including intravenous 10 mg/kg-naloxonazine at 5 minutes (mu-OR antagonist), subcutaneous 30 mg/kg-naloxonazine at 24 hours (micro1-OR antagonist), 3 mg/kg-naltrindole at 45 minutes (delta-OR antagonist) and 5 mg/kg-Nor-binaltorphimine at 6 hours (kappa-OR antagonist) were pre-administered. Plasma concentrations of methadone enantiomers were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass-spectrometry. Methadone dose-dependent inspiratory time (T(I)) increase tended to be linear. Respiratory depression was observed only at 15 mg/kg and characterized by an increase in expiratory time (T(E)) resulting in hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis. Intravenous naloxonazine completely reversed all methadone-related effects on ventilation, while subcutaneous naloxonazine reduced its effects on pH (P < 0.05), PaCO(2) (P < 0.01) and T(E) (P < 0.001) but only partially on T(I) (P < 0.001). Naltrindole reduced methadone-related effects on T(E) (P < 0.001). Nor-binaltorphimine increased methadone-related effects on pH and PaO(2) (P < 0.05) Respiratory effects as a function of plasma R-methadone concentrations showed a decrease in PaO(2) (EC(50): 1.14 microg/ml) at lower concentrations than those necessary for PaCO(2) increase (EC(50): 3.35 microg/ml). Similarly, increased T(I) (EC(50): 0.501 microg/ml) was obtained at lower concentrations than those for T(E) (EC(50): 4.83 microg/ml). Methadone-induced hypoxemia is caused by mu-ORs and modulated by kappa-ORs. Additionally, methadone-induced increase in T(E) is caused by mu1- and delta-opioid receptors while increase in T(I) is caused by mu-ORs."

The aims of the current study are: (1) to characterize the normalization time of PEth in larger samples than previously conducted; (2) to elucidate potential gender differences; and (3) to report the correlation of PEth with other biomarkers and self-reported alcohol consumption. Fifty-seven alcohol-dependent patients (ICD 10 F 10.25; 9 females, 48 males) entering medical detoxification at three study sites were enrolled. The study sample was comprised of 48 males and 9 females, with mean age 43.5. Mean gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) was 209.61 U/l, average mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was 97.35 fl, mean carbohydrate deficient transferrin (%CDT) was 8.68, and mean total ethanol intake in the last 7 days was 1653 g. PEth was measured in heparinized whole blood with a high-pressure liquid chromatography method, while GGT, MCV and %CDT were measured using routine methods. PEth levels at day 1 of detoxification ranged between 0.63 and 26.95 micromol/l (6.22 mean, 4.70 median, SD 4.97). There were no false negatives at day 1. Sensitivities for the other biomarkers were 40.4% for MCV, 73.1% for GGT and 69.2% for %CDT, respectively. No gender differences were found for PEth levels at any time point. Our data suggest that PEth is (1) a suitable intermediate term marker of ethanol intake in both sexes; and (2) sensitivity is extraordinary high in alcohol dependent patients. The results add further evidence to the data that suggest that PEth has potential as a candidate for a sensitive and specific biomarker, which reflects longer-lasting intake of higher amounts of alcohol and seemingly has the above mentioned certain advantages over traditional biomarkers."

Fluorescent contrast agents are used to optimize imaging with CLE, and intravenous fluorescein is the most widely used contrast agent. Fluorescein is FDA-cleared for diagnostic angiography of the retina. For these indications, the safety profile of fluorescein has been well-documented; however, to date, fluorescein is not cleared for use with CLE.Aims:To estimate the rate of serious and total adverse events attributable to intravenous fluorescein when used for gastrointestinal CLE.Methods:We performed a cross sectional survey of 16 International Academic Medical Centres with active research protocols in CLE that involved intravenous fluorescein. Centres using i.v. fluorescein for CLE who were actively monitored for adverse events were included.Results:Sixteen centres performed 2272 gastrointestinal CLE procedures. The most common dose of contrast agent was 2.5-5 mL of 10% sodium fluorescein. No serious adverse events were reported. Mild adverse events occurred in 1.4% of individuals, including nausea/vomiting, transient hypotension without shock, injection site erythema, diffuse rash and mild epigastric pain. The limitation is that only immediate post procedure events were actively monitored.Conclusions:Use of intravenous fluorescein for gastrointestinal CLE appears to be safe with few acute complications."

Infliximab regimens and preventive measures were in accordance with the prevalent guidelines or with the manufacturer's recommendations.Results:One hundred fifty-two patients were included (121 Crohn's disease, 24 ulcerative colitis, 7 indeterminate colitis), with a median of 5 infliximab infusions (IQR 3-8) and 87% of patients received at least three infusions. Seventy-nine per cent of them received concomitant immunomodulators and 70% were pre-medicated with hydrocortisone from the first infusion. After a median follow-up of 142 weeks, 13% presented infusion reactions, 13% viral or bacterial infections and two patients developed neoplasia. The mortality rate was 2.6% (four patients).Conclusions:Infliximab therapy is safe when the recommended preventive measures are implemented, with a rate of serious adverse events less than 10%.

Strategies to diagnose and treat hepatic encephalopathy have evolved considerably.Aim:To examine the updated diagnostic and treatment strategies for hepatic encephalopathy.Methods:Techniques for the clinical, psychometric and neurophysiological evaluation of hepatic encephalopathy are reviewed. The methods reviewed include pure clinical scales (West-Haven), psychometric tests (PSE-syndrome test), neurophysiological tests (EEG, Critical flicker frequency, CFF) and computerized tests (Inhibitory control test, ICT).Results:Clinical scales are limited, whereas psychometric tests (specifically PSE-syndrome test), CFF and ICT can be used to diagnose minimal hepatic encephalopathy. However, there is no single test that can capture the entire spectrum of cognitive impairment. Treatment options and goals depend on the acuity of hepatic encephalopathy. In-patient management should concentrate on supportive care, precipitating factor reversal and lactulose and/or rifaximin therapy. Out-patient therapy should aim to prevent recurrences, and both lactulose and rifaximin have evidence to support their use.Conclusions:Diagnostic techniques for hepatic encephalopathy range from simple scales to sophisticated tools. Treatment options depend on the stage of hepatic encephalopathy. The future challenge is to evaluate cognitive function as a continuum with clinically relevant outcomes and to develop well-tolerated and inexpensive treatments for hepatic encephalopathy."

Nearly 400 million people resided in territories that were contaminated with radioactivity at a level higher than 4 kBq/m(2) (0.11 Ci/km(2)) from April to July 1986. Nearly 5 million people (including, more than 1 million children) still live with dangerous levels of radioactive contamination in Belarus, Ukraine, and European Russia. Claims that the Chernobyl radioactive fallout adds \"only 2%\" to the global radioactive background overshadows the fact that many affected territories had previously dangerously high levels of radiation. Even if the current level is low, there was high irradiation in the first days and weeks after the Chernobyl catastrophe. There is no reasonable explanation for the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency and the World Health Organization (Chernobyl Forum, 2005) have completely neglected the consequences of radioactive contamination in other countries, which received more than 50% of the Chernobyl radionuclides, and addressed concerns only in Belarus, Ukraine, and European Russia."

Using criteria demanded by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) resulted in marked underestimates of the number of fatalities and the extent and degree of sickness among those exposed to radioactive fallout from Chernobyl. Data on exposures were absent or grossly inadequate, while mounting indications of adverse effects became more and more apparent. Using objective information collected by scientists in the affected areas--comparisons of morbidity and mortality in territories characterized by identical physiography, demography, and economy, which differed only in the levels and spectra of radioactive contamination--revealed significant abnormalities associated with irradiation, unrelated to age or sex (e.g., stable chromosomal aberrations), as well as other genetic and nongenetic pathologies."

Adverse effects as a result of Chernobyl irradiation have been found in every group that has been studied. Brain damage has been found in individuals directly exposed--liquidators and those living in the contaminated territories, as well as in their offspring. Premature cataracts; tooth and mouth abnormalities; and blood, lymphatic, heart, lung, gastrointestinal, urologic, bone, and skin diseases afflict and impair people, young and old alike. Endocrine dysfunction, particularly thyroid disease, is far more common than might be expected, with some 1,000 cases of thyroid dysfunction for every case of thyroid cancer, a marked increase after the catastrophe. There are genetic damage and birth defects especially in children of liquidators and in children born in areas with high levels of radioisotope contamination. Immunological abnormalities and increases in viral, bacterial, and parasitic diseases are rife among individuals in the heavily contaminated areas. For more than 20 years, overall morbidity has remained high in those exposed to the irradiation released by Chernobyl. One cannot give credence to the explanation that these numbers are due solely to socioeconomic factors. The negative health consequences of the catastrophe are amply documented in this chapter and concern millions of people."

Since 1990, mortality among liquidators has exceeded the mortality rate in corresponding population groups. From 112,000 to 125,000 liquidators died before 2005--that is, some 15% of the 830,000 members of the Chernobyl cleanup teams. The calculations suggest that the Chernobyl catastrophe has already killed several hundred thousand human beings in a population of several hundred million that was unfortunate enough to live in territories affected by the fallout. The number of Chernobyl victims will continue to grow over many future generations."

        "Abstract": "Air particulate activity over all of the Northern Hemisphere reached its highest levels since the termination of nuclear weapons testing--sometimes up to 1 million times higher than before the Chernobyl contamination. There were essential changes in the ionic, aerosol, and gas structure of the surface air in the heavily contaminated territories, as measured by electroconductivity and air radiolysis. Many years after the catastrophe aerosols from forest fires have dispersed hundreds of kilometers away. The Chernobyl radionuclides concentrate in sediments, water, plants, and animals, sometimes 100,000 times more than the local background level. The consequences of such a shock on aquatic ecosystems is largely unclear. Secondary contamination of freshwater ecosystems occurs as a result of Cs-137 and Sr-90 washout by the high waters of spring. The speed of vertical migration of different radionuclides in floodplains, lowland moors, peat bogs, etc., is about 2-4 cm/year. As a result of this vertical migration of radionuclides in soil, plants with deep root systems absorb them and carry the ones that are buried to the surface again. This transfer is one of the important mechanisms, observed in recent years, that leads to increased doses of internal irradiation among people in the contaminated territories."

        "Abstract": "Plants and mushrooms accumulate the Chernobyl radionuclides at a level that depends upon the soil, the climate, the particular biosphere, the season, spotty radioactive contamination, and the particular species and populations (subspecies, cultivars), etc. Each radionuclide has its own accumulation characteristics (e. g., levels of accumulation for Sr-90 are much higher than for Cs-137, and a thousand times less than that for Ce-144). Coefficients of accumulation and transition ratios vary so much in time and space that it is difficult, if not impossible, to predict the actual levels of Cs-137, Sr-90, Pu-238, Pu-239, Pu-240, and Am-241 at each place and time and for each individual plant or fungus. Chernobyl irradiation has caused structural anomalies and tumorlike changes in many plant species. Unique pathologic complexes are seen in the Chernobyl zone, such as a high percentage of anomalous pollen grains and spores. Chernobyl's irradiation has led to genetic disorders, sometimes continuing for many years, and it appears that it has awakened genes that have been silent over a long evolutionary time."

        "Abstract": "The radioactive shock when the Chernobyl reactor exploded in 1986 combined with chronic low-dose contamination has resulted in morphologic, physiologic, and genetic disorders in every animal species that has been studied--mammals, birds, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates. These populations exhibit a wide variety of morphological deformities not found in other populations. Despite reports of a \"healthy\" environment in proximity to Chernobyl for rare species of birds and mammals, the presence of such wildlife is likely the result of immigration and not from locally sustained populations. Twenty-three years after the catastrophe levels of incorporated radionuclides remain dangerously high for mammals, birds, amphibians, and fish in some areas of Europe. Mutation rates in animal populations in contaminated territories are significantly higher and there is transgenerational genomic instability in animal populations, manifested in adverse cellular and systemic effects. Long-term observations of both wild and experimental animal populations in the heavily contaminated areas show significant increases in morbidity and mortality that bear a striking resemblance to changes in the health of humans--increased occurrence of tumor and immunodeficiencies, decreased life expectancy, early aging, changes in blood and the circulatory system, malformations, and other factors that compromise health."

        "Abstract": "In many European countries levels of I-131, Cs-134/137, Sr-90, and other radionuclides in milk, dairy products, vegetables, grains, meat, and fish increased drastically (sometimes as much as 1,000-fold) immediately after the catastrophe. Up until 1991 the United States imported food products with measurable amounts of Chernobyl radioactive contamination, mostly from Turkey, Italy, Austria, West Germany, Greece, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Sweden, and Denmark. These products included juices, cheeses, pasta, mushrooms, hazelnuts, sage, figs, tea, thyme, juniper, caraway seeds, and apricots. In Gomel, Mogilev, and Brest provinces in Belarus 7-8% of milk and 13-16% of other food products from small farms exceeded permissible levels of Cs-137, even as recently as 2005-2007. As of 2000, up to 90% of the wild berries and mushrooms exceeded permissible levels of Cs-137 in Rovno and Zhytomir provinces, Ukraine. Owing to weight and metabolic differences, a child's radiation exposure is 3-5 times higher than that of an adult on the same diet. From 1995 to 2007, up to 90% of the children from heavily contaminated territories of Belarus had levels of Cs-137 accumulation higher than 15-20 Bq/kg, with maximum levels of up to 7,300 Bq/kg in Narovlya District, Gomel Province. Average levels of incorporated Cs-137 and Sr-90 in the heavily contaminated territories of Belarus, Ukraine, and European Russia did not decline, but rather increased from 1991 to 2005. Given that more than 90% of the current radiation fallout is due to Cs-137, with a half-life of about 30 years, we know that the contaminated areas will be dangerously radioactive for roughly the next three centuries."

        "Abstract": "Tens of thousands of Chernobyl children (mostly from Belarus) annually leave to receive treatment and health care in other countries. Doctors from many countries gratuitously work in the Chernobyl contaminated territories, helping to minimize the consequences of this most terrible technologic catastrophe in history. But the scale and spectrum of the consequences are so high, that no country in the world can cope alone with the long-term consequences of such a catastrophe as Chernobyl. The countries that have suffered the most, especially Ukraine and Belarus, extend gratitude for the help that has come through the United Nations and other international organizations, as well as from private funds and initiatives. Twenty-two years after the Chernobyl releases, the annual individual dose limit in heavily contaminated territories of Belarus, Ukraine, and European Russia exceed 1 mSv/year just because of the unavoidable consumption of locally contaminated products. The 11-year experience of the BELRAD Institute shows that for effective radiation protection it is necessary to establish the interference level for children at 30% of the official dangerous limit (i.e., 15-20 Bq/kg). The direct whole body counting measurements of Cs-137 accumulation in the bodies of inhabitants of the heavily contaminated Belarussian region shows that the official Dose Catalogue underestimates the annual dose burdens by three to eight times. For practical reasons the curative-like use of apple-pectin food additives might be especially helpful for effective decorporation of Cs-137. From 1996 to 2007 a total of more than 160,000 Belarussian children received pectin food additives during 18 to 25 days of treatment (5 g twice a day). As a result, levels of Cs-137 in children's organs decreased after each course of pectin additives by an average of 30 to 40%. Manufacture and application of various pectin-based food additives and drinks (using apples, currants, grapes, sea seaweed, etc.) is one of the most effective ways for individual radioprotection (through decorporation) under circumstances where consumption of radioactively contaminated food is unavoidable."

        "Abstract": "Owing to internally absorbed radionuclides, radiation levels for individuals living in the contaminated territories of Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia have been increasing steadily since 1994. Special protective measures in connection with agriculture, forestry, hunting, and fishing are necessary to protect the health of people in all the radioactively contaminated territories. Among the measures that have proven to be effective in reducing levels of incorporated radionuclides in meat production are food additives with ferrocyanides, zeolites, and mineral salts. Significant decreases in radionuclide levels in crops are achieved using lime/Ca as an antagonist of Sr-90, K fertilizers as antagonists of Cs-137, and phosphoric fertilizers that form a hard, soluble phosphate with Sr-90. Disk tillage and replowing of hayfields incorporating applications of organic and mineral fertilizers reduces the levels of Cs-137 and Sr-90 three- to fivefold in herbage grown in mineral soils. Among food technologies to reduce radionuclide content are cleaning cereal seeds, processing potatoes into starch, processing carbohydrate-containing products into sugars, and processing milk into cream and butter. There are several simple cooking techniques that decrease radionuclides in foodstuffs. Belarus has effectively used some forestry operations to create \"a live partition wall,\" to regulate the redistribution of radionuclides into ecosystems. All such protective measures will be necessary in many European territories for many generations."

        "Abstract": "More than 50% of Chernobyl's radionuclides were dispersed outside of Belarus, Ukraine, and European Russia and caused fallout as far away as North America. In 1986 nearly 400 million people lived in areas radioactively contaminated at a level higher than 4 kBq/m(2) and nearly 5 million individuals are still being exposed to dangerous contamination. The increase in morbidity, premature aging, and mutations is seen in all the contaminated territories that have been studied. The increase in the rates of total mortality for the first 17 years in European Russia was up to 3.75% and in Ukraine it was up to 4.0%. Levels of internal irradiation are increasing owing to plants absorbing and recycling Cs-137, Sr-90, Pu, and Am. During recent years, where internal levels of Cs-137 have exceeded 1 mSv/year, which is considered \"safe,\" it must be lowered to 50 Bq/kg in children and to 75 Bq/kg in adults. Useful practices to accomplish this include applying mineral fertilizers on agricultural lands, K and organosoluble lignin on forestlands, and regular individual consumption of natural pectin enterosorbents. Extensive international help is needed to provide radiation protection for children, especially in Belarus, where over the next 25 to 30 years radionuclides will continue to contaminate plants through the root layers in the soil. Irradiated populations of plants and animals exhibit a variety of morphological deformities and have significantly higher levels of mutations that were rare prior to 1986. The Chernobyl zone is a \"black hole\": some species may persist there only via immigration from uncontaminated areas."

Recent in vitro studies have shown a larger adsorptive capacity for activated charcoal when used in a model of paracetamol overdose. In the present study, we investigated whether this reserve capacity exists in vivo. This is clinically relevant in cases of large overdoses or if the full standard dose of 50 g activated charcoal cannot be administered. We performed a randomized, cross-over study (n = 16). One hour after a standard breakfast, 50 mg/kg paracetamol was administered, followed 1 hr later by an activated charcoal-Water slurry containing 50 (control), 25 or 5 g activated charcoal. The areas under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) for paracetamol were used to estimate the efficacy of each activated charcoal dose. The AUC of the 25-g dose was found to be of similar size compared to the control, although statistics were weak. The AUC of the 5-g dose was 59% larger than the AUC of the 50-g dose (p = 0.0003). The terminal elimination half-life (t(1/2)) of paracetamol was 1.6 (CI 1.4-2.0) and 1.9 (CI 1.5-2.4) hr for 50 and 25 g, respectively (NS), and 2.5 (CI 1.8-3.0) hr for the 5-g dose (p = 0.003). The decrease in t(1/2) of paracetamol for the two larger activated charcoal doses indicates a possible effect of activated charcoal on paracetamol clearance and warrants further investigation. The large adsorptive reserve capacity of activated charcoal in vitro could not be reproduced for the smallest dose of activated charcoal. An activated charcoal-drug ratio of 10:1 is therefore still recommendable."

Endotoxic shock is also associated with an increase in vasodilator prostanoids as well as a decrease in endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and cytochrome P450 4A protein expression, and production of a vasoconstrictor arachidonic acid product, 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a synthetic analogue of 20-HETE, N-[20-hydroxyeicosa-5(Z),14(Z)-dienoyl]glycine (5,14-HEDGE), on the ET-induced changes in eNOS, iNOS and heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) expression as well as 20-HETE and vasodilator prostanoid (6-keto-PGF(1alpha) and PGE(2)) production. ET-induced fall in blood pressure and rise in heart rate were associated with an increase in iNOS protein expression and a decrease in eNOS protein expression in heart, thoracic aorta, kidney and superior mesenteric artery. ET did not change hsp90 protein expression in the tissues. ET-induced changes in eNOS and iNOS protein expression were associated with increased 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) and PGE(2) levels and a decrease in 20-HETE levels, in the serum and kidney. These effects of ET on the iNOS protein expression and 6-keto-PGF(1alpha), PGE(2) and 20-HETE levels were prevented by 5,14-HEDGE. Furthermore, a competitive antagonist of vasoconstrictor effects of 20-HETE, 20-hydroxyeicosa-6(Z),15(Z)-dienoic acid, prevented the effects of 5,14-HEDGE on the ET-induced changes in systemic and renal levels of these prostanoids and 20-HETE. These data are consistent with the view that an increase in systemic and renal 20-HETE levels associated with a decrease in iNOS protein expression and vasodilator prostanoid production contributes to the effect of 5,14-HEDGE to prevent the hypotension during rat endotoxemia."

Epileptogenesis was induced by administration of pentylenetetrazole (30 mg/kg, s.c.) on alternate days (three times/week) for 9-11 weeks or until stage 4 of seizure score was achieved. The neurobehavioural parameters used for cognitive assessment were step-down latency in continuous avoidance apparatus and transfer latency in elevated plus maze test paradigm. Carbamazepine and lamotrigine were administered intraperitoneally in doses of 60 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg, respectively, according to the groups, once a day for 11 weeks. Oxidative stress was assessed in isolated homogenized whole brain samples and estimated for the levels of malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, catalase and superoxide dismutase. The results showed that lamotrigine did not produce any change in cognitive function, while carbamazepine produced cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive decline seen in the carbamazepine-treated pentylenetetrazole-kindled group was also associated with increased oxidative stress. Lamotrigine treatment had no effect on oxidative stress parameters alone, while it significantly decreased oxidative stress in the pentylenetetrazole-kindled group as compared to the pentylenetetrazole-kindled carbamazepine-treated group."

        "Abstract": "A Biopharmaceutics Drug Disposition Classification System (BDDCS) was proposed to serve as a basis for predicting the importance of transporters in determining drug bioavailability and disposition. BDDCS may be useful in predicting: routes of drug elimination; efflux and absorptive transporters effects on oral absorption; when transporter-enzyme interplay will yield clinically significant effects (e.g. low drug bioavailability and drug-drug interactions); and transporter effects on post-absorptive systemic drug levels following oral and i.v. dosing. For highly soluble, highly permeable Class 1 compounds, metabolism is the major route of elimination and transporter effects on drug bioavailability and hepatic disposition are negligible. In contrast for the poorly permeable Class 3 and 4 compounds, metabolism only plays a minor role in drug elimination. Uptake transporters are major determinants of drug bioavailability for these poorly permeable drugs and both uptake and efflux transporters could be important for drug elimination. Highly permeable, poorly soluble, extensively metabolized Class 2 compounds present the most complicated relationship in defining the impact of transporters due to a marked transporter-enzyme interplay. Uptake transporters are unimportant for Class 2 drug bioavailability, (ensure space after,) but can play a major role in hepatic and renal elimination. Efflux transporters have major effects on drug bioavailability, absorption, metabolism and elimination of Class 2 drugs. It is difficult to accurately characterize drugs in terms of the high permeability criteria, i.e. > or =90% absorbed. We suggest that extensive metabolism may substitute for the high permeability characteristic, and that BDDCS using elimination criteria may provide predictability in characterizing drug disposition profiles for all classes of compounds."

In the present study, the effect of a characterized and standardized extract of Zingiber officinale on the hepatic lipid levels as well as on the hepatic mRNA and protein expression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase was investigated in a high-fat diet-fed rat model. Rats were treated with an ethanol extract of Zingiber officinale (400 mg/kg) extract along with a high-fat diet for 6 weeks. The extract of Zingiber officinale significantly decreased hepatic triglyceride and tended to decrease hepatic cholesterol levels when administered over 6 weeks to the rats fed a high-fat diet. We found that in parallel, the extract up-regulated both LDL receptor mRNA and protein level and down-regulated HMG-CoA reductase protein expression in the liver of these rats. The metabolic control of body lipid homeostasis is in part due to enhanced cholesterol biosynthesis and reduced expression of LDL receptor sites following long-term consumption of high-fat diets. The present results show restoration of transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes in low-density lipoprotein and HMG CoA reductase by Zingiber officinale administration with a high-fat diet and provide a rational explanation for the effect of ginger in the treatment of hyperlipidaemia."

        "Abstract": "Anabolic-androgenic steroids are used at high doses by athletes for improving athletic ability, physical appearance and muscle mass. Unfortunately, the abuse of these agents has significantly increased. It has been established that exercise and high doses of anabolic-androgenic steroids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, which can in turn affect testicular apoptosis. However, the effect of the combination of exercise and high dose of anabolic-androgenic steroids on testicular apoptosis is not known. We investigated the combined effects of exercise and high doses of nandrolone decanoate on apoptosis in the spermatogenic cell lineage. Five groups of male Wistar strain albino rats were treated as follows for 8 weeks: solvent of nandrolone decanoate (peanut oil) as a vehicle (Sham); nandrolone decanoate (10 mg/kg/weekly) (nandrolone decanoate); exercise (1 hr/day, 5 days a week) (exercise); nandrolone decanoate (10 mg/kg/weekly) and exercise (1 hr/day, 5 days a week) (nandrolone decanoate exercise); and sedentary control without any injection or exercise (Control). Apoptosis in the male germ line was characterized by TUNEL, caspase-3 assay and transmission electron microscopy. The weights of the testis and accessory sex organs, as well as sperm parameters significantly decreased in the experimental groups relative to the sham and control groups (p < or = 0.05). Germ cell apoptosis and a significant decrease in the number of germ cell layers in nandrolone decanoate exercise-treated testes were observed (p < or = 0.05). Exercise training seems to increase the extent of apoptotic changes caused by supraphysiological dose of nandrolone decanoate in rats, which in turn affects fertility."

Citronellol-induced cardiovascular effects were evaluated in this study. In rats, citronellol (1-20 mg/kg, i.v.) induced hypotension, which was not affected by pre-treatment with atropine, hexamethonium, N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride or indomethacin, and tachycardia, which was only attenuated by pre-treatment with atropine and hexamethonium. These responses were less than those obtained for nifedipine, a reference drug. In intact rings of rat mesenteric artery pre-contracted with 10 microM phenylephrine, citronellol induced relaxations (pD(2) = 0.71 +/- 0.11; E(max) = 102 +/- 5%; n = 6) that were not affected by endothelium removal, after tetraethylamonium in rings without endothelium pre-contracted with KCl 80 mM. Citronellol strongly antagonized (maximal inhibition = 97 +/- 4%; n = 6) the contractions induced by CaCl(2) (10(-6) to 3 x 10(-3 )M) and did not induce additional effects on the maximal response of nifedipine (10 microM). Finally, citronellol inhibited the contractions induced by 10 microM phenylephrine or 20 mM caffeine. The present results suggest that citronellol lowers blood pressure by a direct effect on the vascular smooth muscle leading to vasodilation."

This article focuses on a basic aspect of the debate, namely the plausibility of one or more of these new proposals being able to meet the ethical requirements that those who regard the human embryo as sacred have tried to impose on stem cells research in the last ten years. The thesis of the article is that focusing the discussion only on the sources of stem cells has prevented a full understanding of the foundation, meaning and scope of these ethical requirements. To substantiate this thesis, the article takes into consideration two issues: the first has to do with the potential of the cells obtained through some of the new approaches (iPS included), the second (and decisive) with the argument of the 'indirect complicity', applied to the use of 'contaminated' knowledge."

        "Abstract": "Ethical challenges that arise within healthcare delivery institutions are currently categorized as either clinical or organizational, based on the type of issue. Despite this common binary issue-based methodology, empirical study and increasing academic dialogue indicate that a clear line cannot easily be drawn between organizational and clinical ethics. Disagreement around end-of-life treatments, for example, often spawn value differences amongst parties at both organizational and clinical levels and requires a resolution to address both the case at hand and large-scale underlying system-level confounders. I refer to issues that contain elements of both clinical and organizational issues as hybrids and propose a new taxonomy to characterize hybrid cases. I contend that salient contextual features of an ethical issue, such as where it is identified, who it impacts and where it is ideally resolved in relation to its scope of impact, should inform procedure. Implementation of a Hybrid taxonomy viewing ethical issues as existing on a continuum furthers that end. The primary goals are to 1) systematize thinking about ethical issues that arise within healthcare delivery institutions and 2) allow the content of the ethical challenge to drive the process, rather than continuing to rely on the traditional binary issue-based choice. Failure to capture the complexity of hybrid situations perpetuates incomplete information and ultimately an inchoate resolution that creates more questions than answers."

Despite the emerging importance of online English Sunni fatwas, these fatwas on organ donation and blood transfusion have hardly been studied, thus creating a gap in our knowledge of contemporary Islamic views on the subject.Method:We analysed 70 English Sunni e-fatwas and subjected them to an in-depth text analysis in order to reveal the key concepts in the Islamic ethical framework regarding organ donation and blood transfusion.Results:All 70 fatwas allow for organ donation and blood transfusion. Autotransplantation is no problem at all if done for medical reasons. Allotransplantation, both from a living and a dead donor, appears to be possible though only in quite restricted ways. Xenotransplantation is less often mentioned but can be allowed in case of necessity. Transplantation in general is seen as an ongoing form of charity. Nearly half of the fatwas allowing blood transfusion do so without mentioning any restriction or problem whatsoever. The other half of the fatwas on transfusion contain the same conditional approval as found in the arguments pro organ transplantation.Conclusion:Our findings are very much in line with the international literature on the subject. We found two new elements: debates on the definition of the moment of death are hardly mentioned in the English Sunni fatwas and organ donation and blood transfusion are presented as an ongoing form of charity."

However, some bioethicists have argued that it is useless on three grounds: that it is indeterminate; that it is reactionary; and that it is redundant. In response, a number of defences of dignity have recently emerged. All of these defences claim that when dignity is suitably clarified, it can be of great use in helping us tackle bioethical controversies. This paper rejects such defences of dignity. It outlines the four most plausible conceptions of dignity: dignity as virtuous behaviour; dignity as inherent moral worth; Kantian dignity; and dignity as species integrity. It argues that while each conception is coherent, each is also fundamentally flawed. As such, the paper argues for a bioethics without dignity: an 'undignified bioethics.'"

This paper reports the situation of surrogacy in Japan and in five other regions (the USA, the UK, Taiwan, Korea and France) to clarify the pros and cons of prohibiting surrogacy, along with the problems and issues relating to surrogacy compensation. Not only in a country such as France that completely prohibits surrogacy within the country, but also in a country such as the UK that allows non-commercial surrogacy, infertile couples travel overseas for the purpose of surrogacy. In addition, some couples might seek underground surrogacy if the government prohibits surrogacy. If an intended parent couple and a surrogate make an agreement among themselves and then a problem occurs, they cannot ask for support from professionals or bring a case to court, as can be observed in South Korea and Taiwan. We also conclude that there is little difference between commercial surrogacy and non-commercial surrogacy in the absence of a clear definition of 'reasonable expenses.' In the UK, the law does not allow surrogates to receive compensation. However, in reality, there may be little difference between the amounts paid to surrogates for profit in the US and those paid to surrogates for reasonable expenses in the UK. We conclude that the issue of surrogacy demands further discussion in Japan."

        "Abstract": "Prominent thinkers such as Jurgen Habermas and Michael Sandel are warning that biomedical enhancements will undermine fundamental political values. Yet whether biomedical enhancements will undermine such values depends on how biomedical enhancements will function, how they will be administered and to whom. Since only few enhancements are obtainable, it is difficult to tell whether these predictions are sound. Nevertheless, such warnings are extremely valuable. As a society we must, at the very least, be aware of developments that could have harmful consequences. Indeed, if important values were to be jeopardized, we should take appropriate measures to protect them. This paper focuses on four central values: solidarity, personal responsibility, equality and autonomy. It delineates the conditions under which biomedical enhancements would undermine these values. It also details the circumstances under which these values would be unaffected by enhancements as well as those under which they would be promoted. Specifying these conditions is valuable; it would enable society to prepare appropriate ethical guidelines and policy responses in advance."

Pharmacotherapy for obesity should be considered in combination with lifestyle changes in obese patients, or overweight patients with other conditions that put them at risk of developing heart disease. Sibutramine and orlistat are the only two anti-obesity medications approved for long-term use. Sibutramine is a serotonergic and adrenergic drug that reduces food intake. Orlistat is a gastrointestinal lipase inhibitor that interferes with fat absorption. However, it commonly causes flatulence and diarrhoea. Rimonabant is the first of a series of endocannabinoid receptor antagonists. It was approved by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) as an adjunct to diet and exercise in treating obesity in 2006. However, despite the extensive clinical trial data, EMEA announced in 2008 that it has recommended suspension of rimonabant because of its psychiatric side effects. Studies evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of anti-obesity agents are needed."

        "Abstract": "The genetic contribution to interindividual variation in common obesity has been estimated at 40-70%. Yet, despite a relatively high heritability, the search for obesity susceptibility genes has been an arduous task. This paper reviews recent progress made in the obesity genetics field with an emphasis on established obesity susceptibility loci identified through candidate gene as well as genome-wide studies. For the last 15 years, candidate gene and genome-wide linkage studies have been the two main genetic epidemiological approaches to identify genetic loci for common traits, yet progress has been slow and success limited. Only recently have candidate gene studies started to succeed; by means of large-scale studies and meta-analyses at least five variants in four candidate genes have been found to be robustly associated with obesity-related traits. Genome-wide linkage studies, however, have so far not been able to pinpoint genetic loci for common obesity. The genome-wide association approach, which has become available in recent years, has dramatically changed the pace of gene discoveries for common disease, including obesity. Three waves of large-scale high-density genome-wide association studies have already discovered at least 15 previously unanticipated genetic loci incontrovertibly associated with body mass index and extreme obesity risk. Although the combined contribution of these loci to the variation in obesity risk at the population level is small and their predictive value is typically low, these recently discovered loci are set to improve fundamentally our insights into the pathophysiology of obesity."

Food intake and body weight are tightly regulated by the hypothalamus, brainstem and reward circuits, on the basis both of cognitive inputs and of diverse humoral and neuronal signals of nutritional status. Several gut hormones, including cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide-1, peptide YY, oxyntomodulin, amylin, pancreatic polypeptide and ghrelin, have been shown to play an important role in regulating short-term food intake. These hormones therefore represent potential targets in the development of novel anti-obesity drugs. This review focuses on the role of gut hormones in short- and long-term regulation of food intake, and on the current state of development of gut hormone-based obesity therapies."

We investigated the use of unlicensed antiobesity drugs (orlistat, sibutramine and rimonabant) in children and adolescents (0-18 years) in the UK.Methods:Population-based prescribing data from the UK General Practice Research Database between 1 January 1999 and 31 December 2006.Results:A total of 452 subjects received 1334 prescriptions during the study period. The annual prevalence of antiobesity drug prescriptions rose significantly from 0.006 per 1000 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.0007, 0.0113] in 1999 to 0.091 per 1000 (95% CI 0.07, 0.11) in 2006, a 15-fold increase, with similar increases seen in both genders. The majority of prescriptions were made to those >or=14 years old, although 25 prescriptions were made for children <12 years old. Orlistat accounted for 78.4% of all prescriptions; only one patient was prescribed rimonabant. However, approximately 45% of the patients ceased orlistat and 25% ceased sibutramine after only 1 month. The estimated mean treatment durations for orlistat and sibutramine were 3 and 4 months, respectively.Conclusions:Prescribing of unlicensed antiobesity drugs in children and adolescents has dramatically increased in the past 8 years. The majority are rapidly discontinued before patients can see weight benefit, suggesting they are poorly tolerated or poorly efficacious when used in the general population. Further research into the effectiveness and safety of antiobesity drugs in clinical populations of children and adolescents is needed."

This article is based on the presentation 'New central targets for the treatment of obesity' (Sargent, British Pharmacological society, Clinical Section Symposium, December 2008). Central neuronal substrates controlling weight offer numerous opportunities for pharmacological intervention. These opportunities range from non-specific enhancement of monoamine signalling (triple reuptake inhibitors) to targeting specific monoamine receptor subtypes (5-HT(2c) and 5-HT(6)). The data reviewed suggest that these approaches will lead to weight loss; whether this is sufficient to produce clinically meaningful effect remains to be determined. Combination therapy targeting more than one mechanism may be a means of increasing the magnitude of the response. Preclinical studies also suggest that novel approaches targeting specific neuronal pathways within the hypothalamus, e.g. MCH(1) receptor antagonism, offer an opportunity for weight reduction. However, these approaches are at an early stage and clinical studies will be needed to determine if these novel approaches lead to clinically meaningful weight loss and improvements in co-morbid conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disorders."

The metabolic consequences of obesity include dyslipidaemia, hypertension, proinflammatory atherogenesis, pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. For a significant proportion of patients, pharmacotherapy to tackle obesity is required as adjunctive support to diet, exercise and lifestyle modification. To this end, the pharmaceutical industry is pursuing many novel drug targets. Although this view is probably not justified, the recent tribulations of rimonabant have created a perception that the regulatory bar for the approval of antiobesity drugs has been raised. Although >5% of placebo-subtracted weight loss maintained over 1 year is the primary efficacy end-point, it is improvements in cardiovascular risk factors that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMEA) require to grant approval. Safety aspects are also critical in this indication. Many companies are now switching development of their antiobesity drug candidates into other metabolic disorders. Type 2 diabetes is accepted by the industry and FDA, but not EMEA, as the most appropriate alternative. On the other hand, improvements in plasma lipids produced by antiobesity drugs are moderate compared with established therapies, suggesting dyslipidaemia is not a viable development option. Metabolic Syndrome is not accepted by FDA or EMEA as a discrete disease and the agencies will not licence antiobesity drugs for its treatment. The regulatory environment for antiobesity drugs and the spectrum of indications for which they can be approved could change dramatically if positive data for sibutramine emerge from the SCOUT outcome trial."

Plasma ghrelin concentrations are inversely associated with obesity and food intake. Metformin might therefore affect ghrelin concentrations, although previous studies have shown variable results in this regard. The primary aim of this study was to determine the effect of metformin on plasma ghrelin, appetite and satiety in patients with Type 2 diabetes.Methods:Eighteen patients with Type 2 diabetes were studied before and after 6 weeks of metformin treatment, which was titrated to 1 g b.d. On the study days patients were fed standard meals of 390 kcal at 08.00 and 12.30 h, plasma samples were collected at 15- and 30-min intervals, and appetite and satiety were measured on visual analogue scales. Changes in the area under the concentration-time curves (AUCs) of plasma ghrelin, insulin, glucose, appetite and satiety were assessed and examined for correlations with metformin AUCs. Changes in fasting adiponectin and leptin were also measured.Results:Treatment with metformin increased the mean AUC (07.30-16.30 h) of plasma ghrelin by 24% (P= 0.003), while decreasing those of glucose by 19% (P < 0.001) and insulin by 19% (P= 0.001). No changes were detected in hunger and satiety, or in fasting adiponectin or leptin concentrations. There were no clear correlations between metformin plasma concentrations (AUC) and changes in plasma glucose, insulin or ghrelin.Conclusions:Treatment of Type 2 diabetes with metformin was associated with increased plasma ghrelin concentrations, without associated changes in hunger and satiety."

The aim was to investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles after multiple oral ascending doses of LC15-0444 in healthy male subjects.Methods:A dose block-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study was performed in three groups with 10 subjects (eight for active drug; two for placebo) per group; each group received 200, 400 or 600 mg of LC15-0444 once daily for 10 days. Blood and urine samples were collected up to 24 h after the first dosing and up to 72 h after the last dosing.Results:The LC15-0444 concentration-time profiles exhibited characteristics of multicompartment disposition. No dose- or time-dependent change in PK parameters was observed. Mean elimination half-life was in a range 16.6-20.1 h in the dose groups. Mean renal clearance and fraction of unchanged drug excreted in urine was 18.6-21.9 and 0.40-0.48 l h(-1), respectively. In the steady state, mean accumulation ratios by dose groups were between 1.22 and 1.31. More than 80% inhibition of DPP IV activity from baseline was sustained for >24 h in all dose groups.Conclusions:This study provides evidence of the pharmacological activity of LC15-0444 in humans. LC15-0444 possesses PK and PD characteristics that support a once-daily dosing regimen."

Furthermore, it has been suggested that, instead of the current practice of only measuring HDL-c values, the evaluation of HDL quality might be an improved tool for identifying subjects at increased risk of cardiovascular events. Paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) is an enzyme associated with HDL that is involved in the onset of cardiovascular disease and responsible for HDL antioxidant function. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of EFV on the circulating activity of PON-1 in HIV-infected patients.Methods:The patients included were adults with a documented HIV-1 infection, nontreated or treated with antiretroviral regimens including EFV 600 mg once daily as first therapeutic regimen for at least 3 months. The influence of treatment with EFV, HDL-c and CD4 cell count on PON-1 activity was analysed.Results:HIV-infected White patients treated with EFV had higher PON-1 activity [77.35 U l(-1) (65.66, 89.04)] (P < 0.05) and higher PON-1 activity : HDL-c ratio [1.88 (1.49, 2.28)] (P < 0.01) than untreated patients. PON-1 activity was higher in Black patients (P < 0.001) and in patients with a CD4 cell count >500 cells ml(-1) (P= 0.0120).Conclusions:EFV-based antiretroviral regimens are associated with HDL particles with a better antioxidant function, i.e. with a higher PON-1 activity. The PON-1 activity of Black patients is higher than that found in Whites regardless of treatment. Ethnicity should be taken into consideration when studying drug effects on PON-1 activity."

While the between-group comparisons of the area under the liraglutide concentration-curve (AUC) did not demonstrate equivalence [estimated ratio AUC(severe)/AUC(healthy) 0.73, 90% confidence interval (CI) 0.57, 0.94; and AUC (continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis)(CAPD)/AUC(healthy) 0.74, 90% CI 0.56, 0.97], the regression analysis of log(AUC) for subjects with normal renal function and mild-to-severe renal impairment showed no significant effect of decreasing creatinine clearance on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide. The expected AUC ratio between the two subjects with the lowest and highest creatinine clearance in the study was estimated to be 0.88 (95% CI 0.58, 1.34) (NS). Degree of renal impairment did not appear to be associated with an increased risk of adverse events.Conclusions:This study indicated no safety concerns regarding use of liraglutide in patients with renal impairment. Renal dysfunction was not found to increase exposure of liraglutide, and patients with Type 2 diabetes and renal impairment should use standard treatment regimens of liraglutide. There is, however, currently limited experience with liraglutide in patients beyond mild-stage renal disease."

In addition, the possible metabolic pathways and their modulation according to CYP2C19 genotype were investigated after oral and i.v. administration of voriconazole.Methods:In a single-centre, open-label, two-period crossover study 20 participants received single doses of 400 mg voriconazole orally and 400 mg voriconazole intravenously in randomized order. Blood and urine samples were collected up to 96 h post dose and the voriconazole and three major metabolites were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy.Results:Absolute oral bioavailability of voriconazole was 82.6% (74.1, 91.0). It ranged from 94.4% (78.8, 109.9) in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers to 75.2% (62.9, 87.4) in extensive metabolizers. In contrast to voriconazole and its N-oxide, the plasma concentrations of both hydroxylated metabolites showed a large second peak after 24 h. Independent of the route of administration, voriconazole partial metabolic hydroxylation after i.v. administration was eightfold higher compared with N-oxidation [48.8 ml min(-1) (30.5, 67.1) vs. 6.1 ml min(-1) (4.1, 8.0)]. The formation of the metabolites was related to CYP2C19 activity.Conclusions:Independent of the route of administration, voriconazole exposure was three times higher in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers compared with extensive metabolizers. Voriconazole has a high bioavailability with no large differences between the CYP2C19 genotypes. The hydroxylation pathway of voriconazole elimination exceeded the N-oxidation, both influenced by the CYP2C19 genotype."

There was no detectable effect of the alcohol itself on outcome. * Efforts to reduce deaths from insecticide self-poisoning may benefit from concurrent efforts to reduce alcohol consumption.Aims:Many patients acutely poisoned with organophosphorus insecticides have co-ingested alcohol. Although clinical experience suggests that this makes management more difficult, the relationship between plasma concentration of alcohol and insecticide is unknown. We aimed to determine whether acute intoxication results in ingestion of larger quantities of insecticide in dimethoate self-poisoning and a worse clinical outcome.Methods:We set up a prospective study of acute dimethoate self-poisoning in Sri Lankan district hospitals. An admission plasma sample was analysed to identify the ingested insecticide; in patients with detectable dimethoate, plasma alcohol was measured.Results:Plasma from 37 of 72 (51.4%) dimethoate-poisoned patients had detectable alcohol [median concentration 1.10 g l(-1)[110 mg dl(-1)][interquartile range (IQR) 0.78-1.65]] a median of 3 h post ingestion. The median plasma dimethoate concentration was higher in patients who had ingested alcohol [479 micromol l(-1) (IQR 268-701) vs. 145 micromol l(-1) (IQR 25-337); P < 0.001]. Plasma dimethoate concentration was positively correlated with plasma alcohol (Spearman's rho= 0.34; P= 0.0032). The median alcohol concentration was higher in the 21 patients who died compared with survivors (0.94 vs. 0.0 g l(-1), P= 0.018). Risk of death was greater amongst individuals who consumed alcohol [odds ratio (OR) 4.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 16.4]; this risk was abolished by controlling for dimethoate concentration (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.0, 8.8), indicating that deaths were not due to the direct toxic effects of alcohol.Conclusions:Alcohol co-ingestion is associated with higher plasma concentrations of dimethoate and increased risk of death. Larger studies are required to assess this finding's generalizability, since efforts to reduce deaths from self-poisoning may benefit from concurrent efforts to reduce alcohol consumption."

The study also determined whether 4,4-dimethyl-benziso-(2H)-selenazine (ALT-2074), an investigational organoselenium compound that acts as a catalytic mimic of glutathione oxidase, inhibits CYP3A metabolism in vivo.Methods:Thirteen healthy volunteers received single 3-mg oral doses of midazolam on three occasions: in the control condition, during co-treatment with low-dose ritonavir (three oral doses of 100 mg over 24 h), and during co-treatment with ALT-2074 (three oral doses of 80 mg over 24 h).Results:Ritonavir increased mean (+/-SE) total area under the curve (AUC) for midazolam by a factor of 28.4 +/- 4.2 (P < 0.001), and reduced oral clearance to 4.2 +/- 0.5% of control (P < 0.001). In contrast, ALT-2074 increased midazolam AUC by 1.25 +/- 0.11 (P < 0.05), and reduced oral clearance to 88 +/- 8% of control.Conclusions:Low-dose ritonavir produces extensive CYP3A inhibition exceeding that of ketoconazole (typically 10- to 15-fold midazolam AUC enhancement), and is a suitable positive control index inhibitor for drug-drug interaction studies. ALT-2074 inhibits CYP3A metabolism to a small degree that is of uncertain clinical importance."

Thirty healthy male subjects received 100 mg caffeine, 100 mg metoprolol, 0.03 mg kg(-1) midazolam, 20 mg omeprazole and 10 mg warfarin individually and in combination (cocktail). Poor metabolizers of CYP2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 were excluded. Plasma samples were obtained up to 48 h for caffeine, metoprolol and omeprazole, 12 h for midazolam, 312 h for warfarin and the cocktail. Three different validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry methods were used. Noncompartmental PK parameters were calculated. Log-transformed C(max), AUC(last) and AUC for each analyte were analysed with a linear mixed effects model with fixed term for treatment, sequence and period, and random term for subject within sequence. Point estimates (90% CI) for treatment ratios (individual/cocktail) were computed for each analyte C(max), AUC(last) and AUC.Results:There was no PK interaction between the probe drugs when administered in combination as a cocktail, relative to the probes administered alone, as the 90% CI of the PK parameters was within the prespecified bioequivalence limits of 0.80, 1.25.Conclusion:The lack of interaction between probes indicates that this cocktail could be used to evaluate the potential for multiple drug-drug interactions in vivo."

Beers' criteria are the most widely used but have disadvantages when used in Europe. New IP screening tools called Screening Tool of Older Person's Prescriptions (STOPP) and Screening Tool to Alert doctors to Right Treatment (START) have been developed to identify potential IP and potential prescribing omissions (PPOs). The aim was to measure the prevalence rates of potential IP and PPOs in primary care using Beers' criteria, STOPP and START.Methods:Case records of 1329 patients >or=65 years old from three general practices in one region of southern Ireland were studied. The mean age +/- SD of the patients was 74.9 +/- 6.4 years, 60.9% were female. Patients' current diagnoses and prescription medicines were reviewed and the Beers' criteria, STOPP and START tools applied.Results:The total number of medicines prescribed was 6684; median number of medicines per patient was five (range 1-19). Overall, Beers' criteria identified 286 potentially inappropriate prescriptions in 18.3% (243) of patients, whilst the corresponding IP rate identified by STOPP was 21.4% (284), in respect of 346 potentially inappropriate prescriptions. A total of 333 PPOs were identified in 22.7% (302) of patients using the START tool.Conclusion:Potentially inappropriate drug prescribing and errors of drug omission are highly prevalent among older people living in the community.

Blood samples were taken for pharmacokinetic purposes. Exploratory efficacy measurements included World Health Organization (WHO) functional class and parent's and clinician's Global Clinical Impression scales.Results:Comparing children with a historical group of adults, the geometric mean ratio (90% confidence interval) of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve was 0.54 (0.37, 0.78), i.e. children had lower exposure to bosentan than adults. Bosentan concentrations following doses of 2 and 4 mg kg(-1) were similar. Improvements in WHO functional class and the Global Clinical Impression scales occurred mainly in bosentan-naive patients, whereas the rare worsenings occurred in patients already on bosentan prior to study initiation. The paediatric formulation was well accepted and bosentan well tolerated in this study. No cases of elevated liver enzymes or anaemia were reported.Conclusions:Exposure to bosentan, as shown comparing the results from this study with those from a study in adults, was different in paediatric and adult PAH patients. Since FUTURE-1 and past studies suggest a favourable benefit-risk profile for bosentan at 2 mg kg(-1) b.i.d., this dose is recommended for children with PAH. The new paediatric formulation was well tolerated."

In this case, the abortion data were critical. * The study documents that clinicians should avoid, as much as possible, the use of folic acid antagonists during the first trimester of pregnancy, when embryogenesis takes place.Aim:To investigate the safety of folic acid antagonists during the first trimester of pregnancy in a large cohort.Methods:Computerized databases for medications dispensed from 1998 to 2007 to women registered in 'Clalit' HMO, Israel southern district, was linked with maternal and infant hospitalization records, and to therapeutics abortions data. The risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes of folic acid antagonists exposure was assessed by adjusting for known confounders.Results:Eighty-four thousand, eight hundred and twenty-three infants were born and 998 therapeutic abortions took place; 571 fetuses and infants were exposed to one or more folic acid antagonists in the first trimester of pregnancy. Exposure was associated with an overall increased risk of congenital malformations [odds ratio (OR) 2.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.92, 3.08], due mainly to increased risk for neural tube (adjusted OR 6.5, 95% CI 4.34, 9.15) and cardiovascular defects (OR 1.76, CI 1.05, 2.95).Conclusion:First-trimester exposure to folic acid antagonists is associated with increased risk of congenital malformations."

Family B G protein-coupled receptors contain a putative N-terminal signal peptide, but its role in receptor synthesis and trafficking are unclear. Further, the signal peptide is not cleaved in at least one family member.Experimental approach:We examined receptor glycosylation and the role of the signal peptide in GLP-1R synthesis and trafficking using constructs containing epitope tags at the N- and/or C-terminus and in which the signal peptide sequence was either present or absent.Key results:The signal peptide was absolutely required for GLP-1R synthesis but could be substituted to some extent by increasing positive charge in the N-terminal region of the receptor flanking the signal peptide. The signal peptide is cleaved during synthesis and processing of the receptor. An enhanced GFP-epitope tag at the N-terminus of the receptor permitted synthesis of the receptor but blocked signal peptide cleavage and prevented trafficking to the plasma membrane. Cleavage site mutation allowed synthesis of a full-length receptor, blocked signal peptide cleavage and caused retention within the endoplasmic reticulum.Conclusions and implications:Signal peptide cleavage was not essential for receptor synthesis but was obligatory for processing and trafficking of receptors to the plasma membrane. Further, the GLP-1R is subject to N-linked glycosylation and only the mature, fully glycosylated form of the receptor is present in the plasma membrane. Inhibition of glycosylation prevents processing and cell surface expression of the GLP-1R."

Nevertheless, details of the neural mechanism of action for Ucns have been unclear. We have, here, tested the hypothesis that Ucns act in the enteric nervous system (ENS) to influence colonic motor behaviour.Experimental approach:We used intracellular recording with 'sharp' microelectrodes, followed by intraneuronal injection of biocytin, and immunohistochemical localization of CRF(1) and CRF(2) receptors in guinea pig colonic tissue.Key results:Application of Ucn1 depolarized membrane potentials and elevated excitability in 58% of AH-type and 60% of S-type colonic myenteric neurons. In most of the neurons tested, depolarizing responses evoked by Ucn-1 were suppressed by the CRF(1) receptor antagonist NBI 27914, but were unaffected by the CRF(2) receptor antagonist antisauvagine-30. The selective CRF(2) receptor agonists, Ucn2 and Ucn3, evoked depolarizing responses in 12 and 8% of the AH-type myenteric neurons, respectively, and had no effect on S-type neurons. Antisauvagine-30, but not NBI 27914, suppressed these Ucn2- and Ucn3-evoked responses. Immunohistochemical staining identified CRF(1) as the predominant CRF receptor subtype expressed by ganglion cell somas, while CRF(2)-immunoreactive neuronal somas were sparse. Ucns did not affect excitatory synaptic transmission in the ENS.Conclusions and implications:The results suggest that Ucns act as neuromodulators to influence myenteric neuronal excitability. The excitatory action of Ucn1 in myenteric neurons was primarily at CRF(1) receptors, and the excitatory action of Ucn2 and Ucn3 was at CRF(2) receptors."

        "Abstract": "The worldwide yearly mortality from sepsis is substantial, greater than that of cancer of the lung and breast combined. Moreover, its incidence is increasing, and its response to therapy has not appreciably improved. In this condition, the secretion of procalcitonin (ProCT), the prohormone of calcitonin, is augmented greatly, attaining levels up to thousands of fold of normal. This hypersecretion emanates from multiple tissues throughout the body that are not traditionally viewed as being endocrine. The serum values of ProCT correlate with the severity of sepsis; they recede with its improvement and worsen with exacerbation. Accordingly, as highlighted in this review, serum ProCT has become useful as a biomarker to assist in the diagnosis of sepsis, as well as related infectious or inflammatory conditions. It is also a useful monitor of the clinical course and prognosis, and sensitive and specific assays have been developed for its measurement. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the administration of ProCT to septic animals greatly increases mortality, and several toxic effects of ProCT have been elucidated by in vitro experimental studies. Antibodies have been developed that neutralize the harmful effects of ProCT, and their use markedly decreases the symptomatology and mortality of animals that harbour a highly virulent sepsis analogous to that occurring in humans. This therapy is facilitated by the long duration of serum ProCT elevation, which allows for a broad window of therapeutic opportunity. An experimental groundwork has been established that suggests a potential applicability of such therapy in septic humans."

Therefore, using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we tested whether gestational age affects tissue P-gp activity in the pregnant non-human primate, Macaca nemestrina.Experimental approach:Mid-gestational (day 75 +/- 13, n= 7) and late-gestational (day 150 +/- 10, n= 5) age macaques were imaged after administration of a prototypic P-gp substrate, (11)C-verapamil (13.7-75.4 MBq.kg(-1)), before and during intravenous infusion of a P-gp inhibitor, cyclosporin A (CsA) (12 or 24 mg.kg(-1).h(-1)). Accumulation of radioactivity in the fetal liver served as a reporter of placental P-gp activity. P-gp activity was expressed as CsA-induced percent change in the ratio of the area (0-9 min) under the (11)C-radioactivity concentration-time curve in the tissue (AUC(tissue)) to that in the maternal plasma (AUC(plasma)).Key results:The CsA-induced change in AUC(fetal liver)/AUC(maternal)(plasma) of (11)C-radioactivity significantly increased from mid- (35 +/- 25%) to late gestation (125 +/- 66%). Likewise, the CsA-induced change in AUC(maternal brain)/AUC(plasma) increased from mid- (172 +/- 80%) to late gestation (337 +/- 148%). The AUC ratio for the other maternal tissues was not significantly affected. Neither the CsA blood concentrations nor the level of circulating (11)C-verapamil metabolites were significantly affected by gestational age.Conclusions and implications:P-gp activity at the blood-brain barrier and the placental barrier in the macaque increased with gestational age. If replicated in humans, the exposure of the fetus and maternal brain to P-gp substrate drugs, and therefore their efficacy and toxicity, will change during pregnancy."

This study investigated the effects of colitis on the contractile effects of motilin, an important endocrine regulator of gastric motility, in the antrum.Experimental approach:Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, NF-kappaB activity and motilin receptor density were determined in the antrum of rabbits 5 days after the induction of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid colitis. Smooth muscle and neural responses to motilin were studied in antral smooth muscle strips in vitro.Key results:Colitis did not affect MPO activity, but increased NF-kappaB activity in the antrum. Motilin receptor density in the antrum was not affected. Under control conditions, motilin induced a slowly developing tonic smooth muscle contraction. Five days post-inflammation, tonic contractions to motilin were reduced and preceded by a rapid initial contraction. Other kinases were recruited for the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) (a multi-functional MLC kinase), and for the inhibition of MLC phosphatase (Rho kinase in addition to protein kinase C) to mediate the motilin-induced contractions during inflammation. Colitis potentiated the cholinergic neural on-contractions in the antrum. This was associated with a hyper-reactivity to motilin and an increased muscle response to ACh.Conclusions and implications:Colitis altered the course of the motilin-induced smooth muscle contraction in the antrum. This involved changes in the kinases phosphorylating MLC. Increased cholinergic excitability to motilin in the antrum may play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammation-associated gastric motility disorders."

In this study, we investigated whether the ubiquitous phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) signalling system is also involved in orexin receptor signalling.Experimental approach:Recombinant Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells, expressing human OX(1) receptors, were used as a model system. Arachidonic acid (AA) release was measured from (3)H-AA-labelled cells. Ca(2+) signalling was assessed using single-cell imaging.Key results:Orexins strongly stimulated [(3)H]-AA release (maximally 4.4-fold). Orexin-A was somewhat more potent than orexin-B (pEC(50) = 8.90 and 8.38 respectively). The concentration-response curves appeared biphasic. The release was fully inhibited by the potent cPLA(2) and iPLA(2) inhibitor, methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate, whereas the iPLA(2) inhibitors, R- and S-bromoenol lactone, caused only a partial inhibition. The response was also fully dependent on Ca(2+) influx, and the inhibitor studies suggested involvement of the receptor-operated influx pathway. The receptor-operated pathway, on the other hand, was partially dependent on PLA(2) activity. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase, but not protein kinase C, were involved in the PLA(2) activation at low orexin concentrations.Conclusions and implications:Activation of OX(1) orexin receptors induced a strong, high-potency AA release, possibly via multiple PLA(2) species, and this response may be important for the receptor-operated Ca(2+) influx. The response coincided with other high-potency lipid messenger responses, and may interact with these signals."

Recently, it has been reported that opening of TWIK-related K(+) channel 1 (TREK-1) K(+) channels contributes to the nitrergic IJP in colonic smooth muscle. We investigated the effects of TREK-1 channel blockers on nitrergic neurotransmission in mouse and opossum lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) circular smooth muscle (CSM).Experimental approach:The effects of TREK-1 channel blockers were characterized pharmacologically in murine and opossum gut smooth muscle using conventional intracellular and tension recordings.Key results:In LOS, L-methionine depolarized the resting membrane potential (RMP) but did not inhibit the nitrergic IJP. Cumulative application of theophylline hyperpolarized the RMP and inhibited the nitrergic IJP concentration dependently. The induced membrane hyperpolarization was prevented by pre-application of caffeine, but not by 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo-[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one. 8-Br-cAMP significantly hyperpolarized membrane potential and increased the amplitude of the nitrergic IJP. In opossum LOS muscle strips, L-methionine increased resting tone but had no effect on nerve-mediated LOS relaxation. On the other hand, theophylline markedly inhibited tone. In CSM from mouse proximal colon, L-methionine caused modest inhibition of nitrergic IJPs.Conclusions and implications:TREK-1 channels were not involved in the nitrergic IJP in LOS CSM. Not only does L-methionine have no effect on the nitrergic IJP or LOS relaxation, but the effect of theophylline appears to be due to interruption of Ca(2+)-releasing pathways (i.e. caffeine-like effect) rather than via blockade of TREK-1 channels."

Effects of CBD may be mediated by the activation of 5-HT(1A) receptors. As 5-HT(1A) receptor activation may induce antidepressant-like effects, the aim of this work was to test the hypothesis that CBD would have antidepressant-like activity in mice as assessed by the forced swimming test. We also investigated if these responses depended on the activation of 5-HT(1A) receptors and on hippocampal expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).Experimental approach:Male Swiss mice were given (i.p.) CBD (3, 10, 30, 100 mg*kg(-1)), imipramine (30 mg*kg(-1)) or vehicle and were submitted to the forced swimming test or to an open field arena, 30 min later. An additional group received WAY100635 (0.1 mg*kg(-1), i.p.), a 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist, before CBD (30 mg*kg(-1)) and assessment by the forced swimming test. BDNF protein levels were measured in the hippocampus of another group of mice treated with CBD (30 mg*kg(-1)) and submitted to the forced swimming test.Key results:CBD (30 mg*kg(-1)) treatment reduced immobility time in the forced swimming test, as did the prototype antidepressant imipramine, without changing exploratory behaviour in the open field arena. WAY100635 pretreatment blocked CBD-induced effect in the forced swimming test. CBD (30 mg*kg(-1)) treatment did not change hippocampal BDNF levels.Conclusion and implications:CBD induces antidepressant-like effects comparable to those of imipramine. These effects of CBD were probably mediated by activation of 5-HT(1A) receptors."

We have investigated the reactivity of rat tail arteries over longer periods after removing the terminals by surgical denervation.Experimental approach:Two and 7 weeks after denervation, myography was used to assess contractions of isolated arterial segments to phenylephrine, methoxamine, clonidine, vasopressin and angiotensin II (AII). Denervation was confirmed by lack of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive nerve terminals.Key results:The NET inhibitor, desmethylimipramine, increased the pEC(50) for phenylephrine in control, but not denervated arteries after both 2 and 7 weeks. Relative to controls, pEC(50)s for phenylephrine (with desmethylimipramine), methoxamine, clonidine and vasopressin were increased at 2 but not 7 weeks after denervation. The pEC(50) for phenylephrine in the absence of desmethylimipramine was greater than control after both 2 and 7 weeks' denervation. The maximum contraction to vasopressin was larger than in controls at 2 but not 7 weeks after denervation, whereas contractions to AII were markedly enhanced at both time points.Conclusions and implications:Increased vascular reactivity to alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists, and vasopressin is transient following denervation. After 7 weeks, increased reactivity to phenylephrine can be entirely accounted for by the loss of NETs. Maintained supersensitivity to AII indicates that denervation differentially and selectively affects vascular reactivity to circulating vasoconstrictor agents. This might explain persistent vasoconstriction in denervated skin of humans after nerve injuries."

The pharmacology of most of these has been little investigated, three notable exceptions being Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol and Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabivarin. This investigation addressed the question of whether the little-studied phytocannabinoid, cannabigerol, can activate or block any G protein-coupled receptor.Experimental approach:The [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, performed with mouse brain membranes, was used to test the ability of cannabigerol to produce G protein-coupled receptor activation or blockade. Its ability to displace [(3)H]CP55940 from mouse CB(1) and human CB(2) cannabinoid receptors and to inhibit electrically evoked contractions of the mouse isolated vas deferens was also investigated.Key results:In the brain membrane experiments, cannabigerol behaved as a potent alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist (EC(50)= 0.2 nM) and antagonized the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, R-(+)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (apparent K(B)= 51.9 nM). At 10 microM, it also behaved as a CB(1) receptor competitive antagonist. Additionally, cannabigerol inhibited evoked contractions of the vas deferens in a manner that appeared to be alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated (EC(50)= 72.8 nM) and displayed significant affinity for mouse CB(1) and human CB(2) receptors.Conclusions and implications:This investigation has provided the first evidence that cannabigerol can activate alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, bind to cannabinoid CB(1) and CB(2) receptors and block CB(1) and 5-HT(1A) receptors. It will now be important to investigate why cannabigerol produced signs of agonism more potently in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay than in the vas deferens and also whether it can inhibit noradrenaline uptake in this isolated tissue and in the brain."

(MG-50 i.v.) with or without alagebrium, 100 mg*kg(-1) i.p.Key results:Alagebrium attenuated the increased MG levels in the plasma, aorta, heart, kidney, liver, lung and urine after MG administration. In MG-treated rats, glucose tolerance was impaired, plasma insulin levels were higher and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by adipose tissue was reduced, relative to the corresponding control groups. In rats treated with MG-50 i.v., GLUT4 protein expression and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation were decreased. Alagebrium pretreatment attenuated these effects of MG. In an in vitro assay, alagebrium reduced the amount of detectable MG.Conclusions and implications:Alagebrium acutely attenuated MG-induced glucose intolerance, suggesting a possible preventive role for alagebrium against the harmful effects of MG."

        "Abstract": "Although the mucoid form of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is largely responsible for the progression of lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF), the relationship between factors relating daily-care regimes to mucoidy acquisition are as yet poorly investigated. Fifty-two CF patients registered at the CF centre of Dijon, France, were retrospectively evaluated from the date of Pa colonization either to the first positive sputum culture for mucoid Pa (n = 26) or to the last culture in which the Pa remained non-mucoid (n = 26). All clinical, pathological and therapeutic events were recorded. The association between the parameters collected and mucoid transition of Pa was assessed in a Cox model with time-dependant covariables. The mean follow-up was 4.7 + or - 4.3 years. Three independent parameters were associated with the higher risk of mucoid transition of Pa: persistence of Pa in sputum (OR 7.89; p <0.01), use of inhaled bronchodilators (OR 3.40; p = 0.04), and the use of inhaled colimycin (OR 4.04; p = 0.02). Isolation of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae or Streptococcus pneumoniae in sputum was associated with a lower risk (OR 0.24; p < 0.01). Mucoid transition of Pa was associated with variables that reflected the severity of both lung disease and Pa colonization. Although they do not lead to prophylactic measures, these results corroborate the need to avoid Pa persistence."

        "Abstract": "Chronic respiratory infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the main driver of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The development of resistance to all available antibiotics is a frequent outcome of these infections. The present study aimed to evaluate the activity of the new cephalosporin CXA-101 (FR264205) against a collection of 100 isolates obtained from 50 CF patients from two Spanish hospitals. The collection included the first (early) and the last (late) available isolate from each patient (average interval 68 ± 39 months). The MIC50 and MIC90 of CXA-101 were 0.5 and 2 mg/L and the geometric mean MIC was 0.7 mg/L; the MICs for 95% of the isolates were ≤8 mg/L (tentative breakpoint). Only meropenem yielded comparable results, although the MIC90 of this antibiotic was significantly higher (8 mg/L). CXA-101 showed conserved activity against a high proportion of isolates resistant to each of the antibiotics tested (ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, meropenem, levofloxacin and tobramycin), with MIC50 values of 1-2 mg/L. Moreover, CXA-101 retained good activity against multidrug-resistant strains, with MIC50 and MIC90 values of 2 and 16 mg/L. CXA-101 was also active against late CF isolates (the MIC for 96% was ≤8 mg/L); it was the only antibiotic tested to which a similar percentage of early and late isolates was susceptible. These results show that, despite a slight increase in MICs, major cross-resistance to CXA-101 did not develop during treatment of CF patients with the currently available antipseudomonal agents. Therefore, CXA-101 is envisaged as a valuable alternative for the treatment of chronic respiratory infection caused by P. aeruginosa in CF patients."

We evaluated a modified scheme of the sequential multiplex PCRs adapted to the prevalence of serotypes in Seville (Spain) for determining capsular serotypes of S. pneumoniae invasive clinical isolates. In adults, the modified scheme allowed us to type 73% with the first three reactions, and 92% with two additional PCRs. In paediatric patients, it allowed us to type 73.5% with the first three reactions, and 90% with the two additional PCRs. The multiplex PCR approach was successfully adapted to target the serotypes most prevalent in Seville."

However, as these problems are usually identified after cardiac surgery, it is unclear whether they resulted from the surgery or whether they pre-existed and hence might be explained by complications and events associated with the heart disease itself. The purpose of this study was to examine whether neurocognitive deficits commonly reported after cardiac surgery are present before surgery.Method:Forty-five children (22 males, 23 females; mean age 11 y 6 mo, SD 3 y 0 mo) with cyanotic and acyanotic heart diseases scheduled for elective cardiac surgery were compared with 41 healthy peers (17 males, 24 females; mean age 11 y 10 mo, SD 2 y 10 mo) for attention and processing speed, construction, motor speed, motor planning and fluency, and visual memory. Twenty-three children in the patient group were awaiting their first cardiac surgery and 22 were awaiting follow-up surgery.Results:The patients showed manifest neurocognitive difficulties. Their performance was inferior to that of the healthy comparison group for motor planning (p=0.02) and visual memory (p=0.01). The same neurocognitive profile was found in the group of patients awaiting their first cardiac operation.Interpretation:School-age children with various forms of CHD are at risk of neurocognitive impairments before cardiac surgery."

However, to our knowledge, no published study has prospectively examined the impact of early-life androgens on infant brain growth. We report the association between circulating fetal androgen levels, measured from umbilical-cord blood at birth, and a proxy measure of brain growth: head circumference.Method:Participants were 82 unselected female infants from a large representative birth cohort (mean gestational age 39.4 wks, SD 1.7). Umbilical-cord blood was obtained at birth and analysed for androgen concentrations (total testosterone, androstenedione, dehyrdroepiandrosterone, and its sulphated metabolite). Head circumference and two other measures of growth - weight (mean 3311.4 g, SD 461.3) and length - were measured within 3 days of birth and again at approximately 1 year of age (mean age 13.1 mo, SD 1.1).Results:Multivariate linear regressions found an inverse association between levels of free testosterone and growth in head circumference (correlation=-.24), even when adjusting for sociodemographic/obstetric covariates and head size at birth. Growth in weight and length could not be predicted by free testosterone concentration.Interpretation:This is the first report of an association between prenatal androgen levels and postnatal growth in head circumference. These findings suggest that early-life androgens may impact brain development during infancy."

This study aimed to conduct a systematic review of current data to provide an accurate estimate of the prevalence of non-CP motor impairment in preterm children at school age.Method:We searched the Medline, PubMed, and PsycInfo databases and relevant journals to identify all studies published post-1990 that reported the prevalence of motor impairment in school-aged children born preterm (<37 wks' gestation) using standardised motor assessment batteries. We applied a range of exclusionary criteria, with 11 studies included in the final analyses. We identified two levels of motor impairment commonly reported - mild-moderate and moderate - and conducted a random effects meta-analysis to produce a prevalence estimate for each.Results:The pooled estimate for mild-moderate impairment in preterm children was 40.5/100. and for moderate motor impairment the estimate was 19.0/100. There was also a trend for lower motor impairment levels in samples born before 1990 compared with those born after 1990.Interpretation:Children born preterm are at increased risk of motor impairment, with prevalence three to four times greater than in the general population. This highlights the need for improved surveillance and intervention strategies in this group of children."

Attention, considered to be the brain mechanism responsible for the selection of sensory stimuli, could be disturbed in DMD, contributing, at least partially, to the observed global cognitive deficit. The aim of this study was to investigate attentional function in individuals with DMD.Method:Twenty-five males (mean age 12y; SD 2y 2mo) with DMD and 25 healthy males (mean age 12y; SD 2y) were tested in a visuospatial task (Posner computerized test). They were instructed to respond as quickly as possible to a lateralized visual target stimulus with the ipsilateral hand. Their attention was automatically orientated by a peripheral prime stimulus or, alternatively, voluntarily orientated by a central spatially informative cue.Results:The main result obtained was that the attentional effect (sum of the benefit and the cost of attention) did not differ between the two groups in the case of automatic attention (p=0.846) but was much larger for individuals with DMD than for comparison individuals in the case of voluntary attention (p<0.001).Interpretation:The large voluntary attentional effect exhibited by the participants with DMD seems similar to that of younger children, suggesting that the disease is associated with delayed maturation of voluntary attention mechanisms."

A total of 122 children aged less than 2 years 6 months were assigned to either a comparison or an experimental group. Children in the experimental group were given a home stimulation programme that was updated every 3 months. The home programme included activities to promote motor, cognitive, and speech and language development. Children in the comparison group received no developmental intervention. Children were assessed by a blinded assessor at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 2nd edition.Results:The children in this study came from poor socioeconomic backgrounds and their nutritional status was suboptimal. The experimental group included 60 children (30 males, 30 females) with a mean age of 18 months (SD 8.1 mo). The comparison group included 62 children (32 males, 30 females) with a mean age 19 months (SD 8.2 mo). Cognitive and motor development were severely affected at baseline, with 52% of the children having severe cognitive delay and 72% having severe motor delay at baseline. Children in the experimental group showed significantly greater improvement in cognitive (p=0.010) and motor (p=0.020) development over time than children in the comparison group.Interpretation:A home stimulation programme taught to the caregiver can significantly improve cognitive and motor development in young children infected with HIV."

Performance was compared with test norms.Results:Verbal cognitive functioning fell within the normal range, whereas sustained (p=0.001) and divided attention (p<0.001) were found to be impaired. Greater impairment was observed in executive function in general (p<0.001) and in inhibition (p=0.038) and shifting (p<0.001) in particular. No significant difference was found between types of CP (unilateral and bilateral). Performance of all timed tasks was slower than the test norm (p<0.00).Interpretation:The finding of slower performances across tasks may indicate a general impairment in efficiency of information processing in relation to white-matter lesions. Impairments in attention and executive functions are present in children with CP and may help to explain why these children have increased social and learning problems."

Predictive values of definitely abnormal general movement quality for major neurodevelopmental impairment were calculated.Results:Five children were diagnosed as having a major neurodevelopmental disorder with serious implications for daily life, including three children with cerebral palsy (CP). Three out of the five had shown definitely abnormal general movements; they had lesions involving the periventricular white matter. Two children did not show definitely abnormal general movements; one had unilateral spastic CP due to a cortical lesion and the other had ataxia due to cerebellar atrophy. The positive predictive value of definitely abnormal general movements for major neurodevelopmental impairment was 18/100, and for CP it was 12/100.

Practice times required to achieve automation of movement when writing an unfamiliar character were used to assess the motor learning of handwriting. The children were asked to copy three simple and three complex characters, and the velocity and axial pen force used for corresponding strokes were compared.Results:The attainment of automated handwriting was markedly slower in children with handwriting deficits and DCD, who used a faster stroke velocity to write simple characters (1.22 times those without handwriting deficits), but when writing complex characters, their stroke velocity and pen force were lower (0.85 and 0.89 times those without handwriting deficits, respectively).Interpretation:By linking the results with neuromotor control theories, it was determined that children with DCD have difficulties performing the open-loop and closed-loop movements required for fluent handwriting."

Seventeen mutations involved PDHA1 (a hotspot was identified in exons 6, 7, and 8 in seven males with Leigh syndrome or recurrent ataxia). Mutations in the PDHX gene (five cases) were correlated with non-progressive encephalopathy and long-term survival in four cases.Interpretation:Two types of neurological involvement were identified. Abnormal prenatal brain development resulted in severe non-progressive encephalopathy with callosal agenesis, gyration anomalies, microcephaly with intrauterine growth retardation, or dysmorphia in both males and females (12 cases). Acute energy failure in infant life produced basal ganglia lesions with paroxysmal dystonia, neuropathic ataxia due to axonal transport dysfunction, or epilepsy only in males (11 cases).

Severity of CP was classified by the Gross Motor Function Classification System (48% level I, 17% level II, 15% level III, 8% level IV, 12% level V), type of motor impairment (85% spastic, 12% dyskinetic, 3% ataxic), and limb distribution (36% unilateral, 49% bilateral spastic).Results:Scores on the GMFM-66 explained 90% and 84% respectively, of the variance of scores on PEDI-FSS mobility and PEDI-CAS mobility. Limb distribution moderated the relationship between scores on the GMFM-66 and the PEDI-FSS mobility, revealing a weaker relationship in children with unilateral spastic CP (24% explained variance) than in children with bilateral spastic CP (91% explained variance).Interpretation:In children aged 4 to 7 years with unilateral spastic CP, dissociation between gross motor capacity and daily-life mobility can be observed, just as in typically developing peers."

Factors associated with greater interest in leisure activities were identified.Method:Fifty-five school-aged children (36 males, 19 females; mean age 9 y 11 mo; range 6 y 1 mo-12 y 11 mo) with CP (Gross Motor Function Classification System [GMFCS]) level I 62%, level II 22%, level III-IV 16%; 33.3% hemiplegia, 29.6% diplegia, 25.9% quadriplegia, 11.2% other) who could complete the Preferences for Activities of Children (PAC) were recruited.Results:Social and recreational activities were most preferred, and self-improvement activities were least preferred. Younger age, higher motivation, and IQ predicted interest in active-physical activities (r(2)=0.39). Negative reaction to failure was associated with less preference for social activities (r(2)=0.16), whereas increased prosocial behaviours were related to greater preference for recreational (r(2)=0.13) and self-improvement activities; the latter is also predicted by older age (r(2)=0.24). Interest in skill-based activities was greater in females and in children who were highly motivated, younger, and had greater motor limitations (r(2)=0.51). The findings suggest that personal factors and functional abilities influence leisure activity preferences. High preference for certain activities was not always associated with involvement in these activities.Interpretation:Determination of preferences is inherent to child-centred practice and should, therefore, be part of the evaluation process. Rehabilitation strategies can minimize barriers to leisure participation, such as fear of failure, low motivation, or environmental obstacles."

Abnormal outcomes at the age of 2 years were defined as neurosensory disability (cerebral palsy, blindness, or bilateral hearing loss) or delay (no neurosensory disability but Bayley Scales of Infant Development mental or performance developmental index scores <70). School readiness (assessed at a mean age of 5y 6mo, SD 1y) was determined using neurodevelopmental assessments of motor, sensory, receptive vocabulary, perceptual, conceptual, and adaptive skills.Results:The mean birthweight of the cohort (57 males, 64 females) was 987g (SD 374), and the mean gestational age was 27.3 weeks (SD 2.6). At the age of 2 years, the neurodevelopmental classification was 'disabled' in 11% and 'delayed' in 23%. At the age of 5 years 6 months, intensive special education was required for 11% and some special education for 21%. Disability and delay at the age of 2 years were 92% and 50% predictive of lack of school readiness respectively, whereas only 15% of children who were normal at the age of 2 years were not school ready at the later assessment. Children with delay at 2 years were more likely to need special education if they were socially disadvantaged.Interpretation:Without preschool developmental supports, preterm survivors living in poverty will require more special education services."

We investigated whether the APOE genotype is associated with cerebral palsy (CP) and whether patients with CP with comorbid conditions and more severe neurological deficits are likely to have a particular genotype.Method:In a cross-sectional study, 243 individuals with spastic CP (135 males, 108 females; mean age at data collection 11 year ([SD 6y 7mo], 34% with hemiplegia, 37% with diplegia, 29% with triplegia/tetraplegia; 44% with mild motor involvement), 31% with moderate motor involvement, 25% with severe motor involvement, were compared with healthy individuals matched by age, race, and sex to analyse the association between APOE genotype and the incidence of CP. Associations between the APOE genotype and the incidence of comorbidities and neurological deficits were studied in the group with CP.Results:The APOE epsilon2epsilon3 genotype was significantly more prevalent in the group with CP (11%) than the comparison group (5%) (odds ratio [OR] 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-7.66). The presence of the epsilon2 allele raised the probability of having CP (OR 3.2; 95% CI 1.27-8.27). The presence of ApoE epsilon4 was not significantly different among groups. No relation was found between APOE genotype and severity of neurological deficit or distribution of motor involvement. Four patients with CP presented the epsilon4epsilon4 genotype, and all exhibited epilepsy and microcephaly. Eleven of 12 individuals with CP and macrocephaly carried the epsilon3epsilon3 genotype.Interpretation:A higher prevalence of the APOE epsilon2 genotype was found among those with CP. The association of microcephaly and epilepsy with the epsilon4epsilon4 genotype and the association of macrocephaly with epsilon3 demand further investigation."

P. aeruginosa faecal carriage among captive snakes was high (72 out of 83 individuals), but low among wild specimen (3 out of 23 individuals). Genetic diversity analyses of the isolates, based on SpeI-PFGE profiles, evidenced five dominant clones or clonal complexes spreading among snakes within a site and between sites and persisting over time. Similar clones or clonal complexes were detected from mouth swabs of the owners and from water and preys used to feed the snakes, evidencing various sources of snake colonization and the first cases of P. aeruginosa cross-contamination between snakes and owners. These observations led to the conclusion that P. aeruginosa behaves as an opportunistic species within snakes in captivity and that colonization and dissemination occurs consecutively to processes similar to those identified within the hospital. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed that most isolates had a wild-type resistance profile except for one persistent clone isolated from both snakes and preys that harboured multiple antimicrobial resistance genes mediated by an integron carrying the qacH, aadB, aadA2 and cmlA10 cassettes, and a tetA(C)-carrying transposon. Biocides or antibiotics used in the zoological garden could have led to the acquisition of this integron."

In this study, we examined the spatial distributions of ammonia-oxidizing Crenarchaea across a large (approximately 5200 km) region of the central Pacific Ocean. Examination of crenarchaeal 16S rRNA, ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) genes, and amoA transcript abundances provided insight into their spatial distributions and activities. Crenarchaeal gene abundances increased three to four orders of magnitude with depth between the upper ocean waters and dimly lit waters of the mesopelagic zone. The resulting median value of the crenarchaeal amoA: 16S rRNA gene ratio was 1.3, suggesting the majority of Crenarchaea in the epi- and mesopelagic regions of the Pacific Ocean have the metabolic machinery for ammonia oxidation. Crenarchaeal amoA transcript abundances typically increased one to two orders of magnitude in the transitional zone separating the epipelagic waters from the mesopelagic (100-200 m), before decreasing into the interior of the mesopelagic zone. The resulting gene copy normalized transcript abundances revealed elevated amoA expression in the upper ocean waters (0-100 m) where crenarchaeal abundances were low, with transcripts decreasing into the mesopelagic zone as crenarchaeal gene abundances increased. These results suggest ammonia-oxidizing Crenarchaea are active contributors to the N cycle throughout the epi- and mesopelagic waters of the Pacific Ocean."

It is accepted that a taxa abundance distribution for a given community of animals or plants following a perturbation will typically change in structure from one of high evenness to increasing dominance. Subsequently, such changes in evenness have been used as indicators of biological integrity and environmental assessment. Here, using replicated experimental treehole microcosms perturbed with different concentrations of the pollutant pentachlorophenol, we investigated whether changes in bacterial community structure would reflect the effects of anthropogenic stress in a similar manner to larger organisms. Community structure was visualized using rank-abundance plots fitted with linear regression models. The slopes of the regression models were used as a descriptive statistic of changes in evenness over time. Our findings showed that bacterial community structure reflected the impact and the recovery from an anthropogenic disturbance. In addition, the intensity of impact and the rate of recovery to pre-perturbation structure were dose-dependent. These properties of bacterial community structures may potentially provide a metric for environmental assessment and regulation."

Independent of the origin, Fusarium spp. were detected in the different rice seed samples with infection rate ranges that varied from 0.25% to 9%. Four Fusaria (F. andiyazi, F. fujikuroi, F. proliferatum and F. verticillioides) were found associated with Bakanae of rice. While three of the Fusaria were found in both African and Asian seed samples, F. fujikuroi was only detected in seed samples from Asia. Phylogenetic studies showed a broad genetic variation among the strains that were distributed into four different genetic clades. Pathogenicity tests showed that all strains reduced seed germination and possessed varying ability to cause symptoms of Bakanae on rice, some species (i.e. F. fujikuroi) being more pathogenic than others. The ability to produce fumonisins (FB(1) and FB(2)) and gibberellin A3 in vitro also differed according to the Fusarium species. While fumonisins were produced by most of the strains of F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum, gibberellin A3 was only produced by F. fujikuroi. Neither fumonisin nor gibberellin was synthesized by most of the strains of F. andiyazi. These findings provide new information on the variation within the G. fujikuroi species complex associated with rice seed and Bakanae disease."

However, there is evidence that grazing by protozoans exerts top-down controls on biomass. Here, we investigate top-down control by phage on soil microbes using an experimental site near Barrow, Alaska (71 degrees N, 157 degrees W) during the 2007 growing season. Soil measurements were taken from sites that covered a range of microtopographical features within a drained and thawed lake basin including high- and low-centred ice-wedge polygons to estimate the availability of carbon and nitrogen for microbes. Using both field and laboratory experiments, we successfully increased both microbial biomass and respiration by decreasing phage populations. The addition of carbon and nutrients to soils had no significant effects on biomass or respiration, indicating a lack of bottom-up controls. Additionally, we present the first use of tea extracts as a potent anti-phage agent in soils. Our results suggest that top-down controls, such as phage predation, are critical to regulation of microbial activities in Arctic soils."

We explored this hypothesis, by following phage cycle dynamics, host physiological state and metabolic activity over an annual cycle in three lakes subjected to strong seasonal fluctuations, including 4-5 months of ice cover. We observed marked seasonal dynamics of viral and bacterial communities, with low bulk and cell-specific bacterial metabolism in winter, and a dramatic increase in injured bacteria under the ice cover in all lakes. This period was accompanied by contrasting patterns in the proportion of lysogenic cells. In the eutrophic lake, times of low bacterial metabolic rates and high proportion of damaged cells corresponded to highest levels of lysogeny, supporting the notion that hosts are a 'refuge' for viruses. In the two unproductive lakes, peaks of injured cells corresponded to a minimum of lysogeny, suggesting an 'abandon the sinking ship' response, where the prophage replicates before the loss of genome. We suggest that these diverging responses to the host physiological state are not contradictory, but rather that there may be thresholds of cell stress and metabolic activity leading to one or the other response."

An extensive phenotypic and genomic diversity analysis was conducted to elucidate the molecular basis of the high flexibility and versatility of this species. First, 185 isolates from diverse environments were phenotypically characterized by evaluating their fermentation and growth characteristics. Strains clustered largely together within their particular food niche, but human fecal isolates were scattered throughout the food clusters, suggesting that they originate from the food eaten by the individuals. Based on distinct phenotypic profiles, 24 strains were selected and, together with a further 18 strains from an earlier low-resolution study, their genomic diversity was evaluated by comparative genome hybridization against the reference genome of L. plantarum WCFS1. Over 2000 genes were identified that constitute the core genome of the L. plantarum species, including 121 unique L. plantarum-marker genes that have not been found in other lactic acid bacteria. Over 50 genes unique for the reference strain WCFS1 were identified that were absent in the other L. plantarum strains. Strains of the L. plantarum subspecies argentoratensis were found to lack a common set of 24 genes, organized in seven gene clusters/operons, supporting their classification as a separate subspecies. The results provide a detailed view on phenotypic and genomic diversity of L. plantarum and lead to a better comprehension of niche adaptation and functionality of the organism."

Previous work showed that Bti is highly toxic to Anopheles albimanus, the main vector for transmission of malaria in Mexico. In this work, we analysed the toxicity of isolated Cry proteins of Bti and identified an An. albimanus midgut protein as a putative Cry4Ba and Cry11Aa receptor molecule. Biossays showed that Cry4Ba and Cry11Aa of Bti are toxic to An. albimanus larvae. Ligand blot assays indicated that a 70 kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein present in midgut brush border membrane vesicles of An. albimanus interacts with Cry4Ba and Cry11Aa toxins. This protein was identified as an alpha-amylase by mass spectrometry and enzymatic activity assays. The cDNA that codes for the alpha-amylase was cloned by means of 5'- and 3'-RACE experiments. Recombinant alpha-amylase expressed in Escherichia coli specifically binds Cry4Ba and Cry11Aa toxins."

Archaea were not abundant but DNA sufficient for producing 16S rRNA gene clone libraries was extracted from 18 of 51 soil samples, from four locations. A total of 1452 clones were analysed by restriction fragment length polymorphism and assigned to 43 operational taxonomic units from which representatives were sequenced. Archaea were primarily restricted to coastal mineral soils which showed a predominance of Crenarchaeota belonging to group 1.1b (> 99% of clones). These clones were assigned to six clusters (A through F), based on shared identity to sequences in the GenBank database. Ordination indicated that soil chemistry and water content determined archaeal community structure. This is the first comprehensive study of the archaeal community in Antarctic soils and as such provides a reference point for further investigation of microbial function in this environment."

Data were obtained via (1) a nationwide population-based health survey, (2) secondary data analysis of all reimbursements for prescriptions of antiepilepsy medication nationwide from 2002 to 2005, (3) a nationwide survey of primary care community-based physicians, (4) a nationwide survey of specialist care hospital-based neurologists, and (5) secondary data analysis of inpatient discharges from acute hospitals nationwide for persons with a diagnosis of epilepsy between 2000 and 2005.Results:The findings indicate that nationwide approximately (1) 10 per 1,000 persons (n = 31,000) 18 years and older have self-reported lifetime prevalence of epilepsy, (2) 8.3-9 per 1,000 (approximately 33,000-36,000) persons 5 years and older are being treated for epilepsy using antiepilepsy medication, (3) the typical general practitioner provides care to an average of 13 patients with active epilepsy and epilepsy in remission with treatment, (4) specialist care is provided on a weekly basis to approximately 442 persons with active epilepsy and epilepsy in remission with treatment, and (5) approximately 67 discharges for persons with a primary or secondary diagnosis of epilepsy are reported from acute hospitals weekly.Discussion:This study is distinguished as the first nationwide prevalence study of epilepsy in Europe and provides previously unavailable data on this population in Ireland. Moreover, this study illustrates the merits of secondary data analysis of existing sources when access to clinical sources for the purpose of identifying epidemiologic samples is limited."

        "Abstract": "Purpose:The thalamus plays an important role in seizure propagation in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). This study investigated how structural abnormalities in the focus, ipsilateral thalamus and extrafocal cortical structures relate to each other in TLE with mesiotemporal sclerosis (TLE-MTS) and without hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-no).Methods:T₁ and high-resolution T₂ images were acquired on a 4T magnet in 29 controls, 15 TLE-MTS cases, and 14 TLE-no. Thalamus volumes were obtained by warping a labeled atlas onto each subject's brain. Deformation-based morphometry was used to identify regions of thalamic volume loss and FreeSurfer for cortical thickness measurements. CA1 volumes were obtained from high-resolution T₂ images. Multiple regression analysis and correlation analyses for voxel- and vertex-based analyses were performed in SPM2 and FreeSurfer.Results:TLE-MTS had bilateral volume loss in the anterior thalamus, which was correlated with CA1 volume and cortical thinning in the mesiotemporal lobe. TLE-no had less severe volume loss in the dorsal lateral nucleus, which was correlated with thinning in the mesiotemporal region but not with extratemporal thinning.Discussion:The findings suggest that seizure propagation from the presumed epileptogenic focus or regions close to it into the thalamus occurs in TLE-MTS and TLE-no and results in circumscribed neuronal loss in the thalamus. However, seizure spread beyond the thalamus seems not to be responsible for the extensive extratemporal cortical abnormalities in TLE."

        "Abstract": "Purpose:Valproic acid (VPA) is widely used clinically in epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and migraine. In experimental models, it has also been shown to have neuroprotective and antiepileptogenic effects. Its mechanisms of action in these diverse conditions are, however, unclear, but there is some evidence indicating an effect of VPA upon protein kinase A (PKA) activity. We, therefore, asked whether VPA modulates cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/PKA-dependent synaptic plasticity and whether this mode of action could explain its anticonvulsant effect.Methods:We first tested the effects of VPA on PKA-dependent synaptic plasticity at mossy fiber to CA3 synapses in rat hippocampus slices following very high-frequency stimulation or application of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin. Using biochemical assays, we then tested whether VPA had a direct effect on PKA activity or an indirect effect through modulating cAMP production. Lastly, VPA and inhibitors of adenylyl cyclase (SQ22536) and PKA (H89) were tested in in vitro models of epileptiform activity induced in hippocampal-entorhinal cortex slices using either pentylenetetrazol (2 mM) or low magnesium.Results:VPA (1 mm) inhibited PKA-dependent long-term potentiation of mossy fiber to CA3 pyramidal cell transmission. However, VPA did not directly modulate PKA activity but rather inhibited the accumulation of cAMP. In acute in vitro seizure models, the anticonvulsant activity of VPA is not mediated through modulation of adenylyl cyclase or PKA.Conclusions: These results indicate that VPA through an action on cAMP accumulation can inhibit synaptic plasticity, but this cannot fully explain its anticonvulsant effect."

Moreover, analyses have been performed exclusively using paper-recorded EEG, and reported prevalences differ significantly. With recent reports using these data as reference suggesting an increased prevalence of epileptiform EEG discharges in children with behavioral disturbances, acquisition of exact prevalence data has become even more critical. The aim of our study was to analyze the frequency of epileptiform EEG discharges in healthy children using digitally recorded EEG (DEEG) and to compare these data to those of previously published studies.Methods:Prospective analysis of DEEG was performed in 382 healthy children (226 male, 156 female) ages 6-13 years admitted to our hospital for minor head trauma. Recording was carried out for a minimum of 20 min including hyperventilation and photic stimulation. Analysis was carried out by two board-certified clinical neurophysiologists.Results:Epileptiform EEG discharges were detected in 25 of 382 children (11 of 226 male, 14 of 156 female) corresponding to an overall prevalence of 6.5%. Of these 25 children, 4 had either generalized or bifrontal spikes, 12 showed constant localized focal discharges, and 9 showed multifocal discharges. Compared to previous studies using non-DEEG recording, the prevalence of epileptiform EEG discharges in our population was significantly higher. No significant difference was found when comparing our data to prevalences recently reported in children with behavioral disturbances using DEEG.Conclusions:Our study further highlights the urgent need to reevaluate the prevalence of epileptiform EEG discharges in healthy children using DEEG recordings in a large cohort."

Its incidence among elderly patients with confusion of unknown origin (CUO) remains undetermined.Methods:A 1-year prospective study was conducted in patients aged 60 years or older, for whom EEG was requested because of confusion considered to be of unknown origin after initial clinical, biologic, and imaging investigations. Diagnosis criteria included a validated clinical assessment scale to confirm confusion.Results:Of 44 patients with confirmed CUO, 7 presented with de novo NCSE. NCSE population had a mean age of 76 years (range, 60-97 years). No statistically significant differences were found between NCSE patients and others for age, drugs, presence of myoclonia, eyelid myoclonia, tachycardia, or agitation. In contrast, an acute onset (<24 h), gender (100% female among NCSE patients), and lack of clinical response to simple commands were significantly associated with NCSE. No differences between the two groups were evidenced for mortality and morbidity (length of hospitalization, social outcome, and so on).Discussion:Almost 16% of patients aged 60 or older with confusion of unknown origin had NCSE, according to this first prospective study. Female patients with rapid onset (<24 h) of symptoms and lack of response to simple commands were at a higher risk of presenting with NCSE."

Because seizure recurrences may occur in the setting of a persisting or reemerging acute symptomatic cause or in the setting of an unprovoked seizure, we documented the prognosis of ASS in terms of acute symptomatic seizure (AS) or unprovoked seizure (US) recurrence.Methods:We conducted a prospective study of patients with suspected seizures between April 2004 and December 2005. Patients were classified according to medical history taking, routine clinical evaluation, and expert adjudication, and they were followed for a minimum of 2 years or until death. The Kaplan-Meier method and univariate/multivariate statistical analysis were used to determine prognosis.Results:One hundred five patients with first-ever ASS were identified. For many, first ASS was associated with status epilepticus (29.5%), multiple-onset (>1 seizure within 24 h on day of presentation) (35.2%), and multiple etiologies (22.9%), with a mortality of 30% at 2 years (Kaplan-Meier method). Using AS as outcome, the risk of recurrence following an ASS was 32% at 2 years [mean time to recurrence 20.5 days with epileptiform electroencephalography (EEG) being an independent predictor; p = 0.005, odds ratio (OR) 16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.09-62.7]. Using US as outcome, the risk of recurrence following an ASS was 12% at 2 years.Discussion:Although ASS did not associate with a high rate of US recurrence, we demonstrated that ASS was often followed by another AS. This may have implication for short- to medium-term antiepileptic agent therapy, especially when the acute symptomatic cause takes a long time to treat, is prone to reemergence, or is irreversible."

We have previously shown that Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (Theiler's virus or TMEV) infection causes acute symptomatic seizures in C57BL/6 (B6) mice. The objective of the present study was threefold: (1) to assess pathologic changes associated with acute TMEV infection and infection-induced seizures, (2) to determine whether Theiler's virus infection and associated acute seizures lead to chronically altered seizure susceptibility, and (3) to determine whether genetic background influences seizure susceptibility following Theiler's virus infection.Methods:Immunohistochemical techniques were used to assess Theiler's virus antigen localization in the brain and associated neuronal cell death. A battery of electroconvulsive threshold (ECT) tests and corneal kindling studies were conducted to assess whether there were chronic alterations in seizure susceptibility and kindling development. Studies were conducted in both B6 and SJL/J mice to assess strain-dependent effects.Results:Histopathologic analyses indicate that TMEV has specific tropism for limbic structures and causes widespread cell death in these regions. Results from ECT studies demonstrate that B6 mice that displayed acute symptomatic seizures have significantly reduced seizure thresholds and kindle faster than either control mice or infected mice without acute seizures. Furthermore, these effects were mouse-strain dependent, since SJL/J mice displayed a different seizure threshold spectrum.Discussion:These findings indicate that Theiler's virus infection leads to chronically altered seizure susceptibility in mice. It is important to note that Theiler's virus infection of B6 mice represents a novel model to study postinfection hyperexcitability."

We extracted information for individuals with insurance claims suggestive of epilepsy. Using iterative expert classification, we sorted patients by type of epilepsy. For each type we calculated prevalence and HRU. A distance analysis identified closely similar types, and a principal components analysis revealed dimensions of variation in HRU.Results:The prevalence of active epilepsy was 3.4 per 1,000. Most common diagnoses among 46,847 patients were generalized convulsive epilepsy (33.3%) and complex partial seizures (24.8%). Patients averaged 10 physician visits per year, 24 diagnostic tests/procedures per year, >30 drug dispensings per year, and <1 emergency room (ER) visit per year, the minority of each of these being related to epilepsy. Female patients generally had more HRU, and HRU increased with age. Patients were hospitalized most frequently for disorders other than epilepsy. HRU was similar for most epilepsy types, excepting grand mal status, epilepsia partialis continua, and infantile spasms. The first principal components of HRU variation was nonepilepsy HRU, followed by components of epilepsy-related medications, other epilepsy/emergency care, and epilepsy visits/diagnostic procedures.Discussion:The prevalence of active epilepsy in the United States is substantially less than the prevalence of any history of recurrent seizure. Nonepilepsy-related HRU dominated HRU in epilepsy patients and was the principal source of variation. There is a core set of epilepsy diagnoses, the HRU patterns of which are indistinguishable, whereas patients with grand mal status, epilepsia partialis continua, and infantile spasms all have distinct patterns. To provide more specific insights into the economic impact of the condition, studies of HRU in epilepsy should make a distinction about epilepsy-related and unrelated care."

Control group was an age- and gender-matched cohort of randomly chosen beneficiaries without epilepsy (ICD-9-CM: 345.x). All were required to have continuous health coverage during 2004 (baseline) and 2005 (study period). Chi-square tests were used to compare baseline comorbidities. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used for comparisons of annual direct (medical and pharmaceutical) and indirect costs during the study period.Results:Patients with POS were on average 42 years of age, and 57% were women. Patients with POS had significantly higher rates of mental health disorders, migraine, and other neurologic disorders, and higher Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) compared with controls. On average, direct annual costs were significantly higher for POS patients ($11,276) compared with controls ($4,087), p < 0.001; difference of $7,190. Epilepsy-related costs (i.e., costs for antiepileptic drugs, claims with epilepsy or convulsions diagnoses) accounted for $3,290 (29% of direct costs). Employees with POS had substantial and significantly higher indirect (disability- and medically related absenteeism) costs compared with controls ($3,431 vs. $1,511, p < 0.001). Multivariate analyses supported the matched-control univariate findings.Conclusion:Patients with POS had significantly higher costs compared with matched controls. Epilepsy-related costs underestimate the excess costs of patients with partial onset seizures."

The arcuate fasciculus (AF) connects anterior (Broca's) and posterior (Wernicke's) language areas. We hypothesized that essential language areas identified by direct cortical stimulation would colocalize with areas revealing subcortical connectivity via the AF.Methods:Fourteen patients with pharmacoresistant left hemispheric epilepsy and left hemisphere language dominance underwent invasive evaluations for localization of epileptogenicity and functional mapping. DTI and T1-weighted volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were coregistered, and subdural grid electrodes identified on postimplantation computed tomography (CT) scans were also coregistered to the MRI scans. The AF was reconstructed from a region lateral to the corona radiata on the FA map. Colocalization, defined as <1 cm between the AF and the electrode positions delineating language cortex, was visually assessed with excellent reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.98).Results:A total of 71 subdural grid contacts were overlying language cortex. Nineteen contacts in eight patients were over Broca's area, 16 of which (84.2%) colocalized with the AF. Fifty-two contacts in 10 patients were over Wernicke's area, with colocalization in 29 patients (55.8%). Colocalization was significantly greater in anterior regions than in posterior regions [chi(2)(1) = 4.850, p < 0.05].Discussion:The AF, as visualized with DTI, colocalized well with anterior language areas, but less so with posterior language areas, inferring that the latter are more spatially dispersed."

VFOs were recorded from rat neocortical slices. A \"cellular automaton\" model of network oscillations was developed, extending ideas of Traub et al. (Neuroscience, 92, 1999, 407) and Lewis & Rinzel (Network: Comput Neural Syst, 11, 2000, 299); this model is based on postulated electrical coupling between pyramidal cell axons.Results:Layer 5 of rat neocortex, in vitro, can generate VFOs when chemical synapses are blocked. Human epileptic neocortex, in situ, produces preseizure VFOs characterized by the sudden appearance of \"blobs\" of activity that evolve into spreading wavefronts. When wavefronts meet, they coalesce and propagate perpendicularly but never pass through each other. This type of pattern has been described by Lewis & Rinzel in cellular automaton models with spatially localized connectivity, and is demonstrated here with 120,000- to 5,760,000-cell models. We provide a formula for estimating VFO period from structural parameters and estimate the spatial scale of the connectivity.Discussion:These data provide further evidence, albeit indirect, that preseizure VFOs are generated by networks of pyramidal neurons coupled by gap junctions, each predominantly confined to pairs of neurons having somata separated by < ∼1-2 mm. Plausible antiepileptic targets are tissue mechanisms, such as pH regulation, that influence gap-junction conductance."

In addition, in a statistical morphometric analysis, MRI studies from four children with HIMAL were compared to similar images of 20 age-matched typically developing control children.Results:Although the task battery was sensitive to the memory deficit of the children with hippocampal sclerosis, it did not reveal memory impairment in the patients with HIMAL. In contrast, the patients with HIMAL were impaired on the attentionally more demanding dual tasks, compared to both the control and the hippocampal sclerosis group. The structural MRI analysis revealed morphometric abnormalities in the tail of the affected hippocampus, the adjacent neocortex, and the ipsilateral medial thalamus. The basal forebrain was bilaterally affected. Abnormalities in remote cortex were found in the ipsilateral temporal lobe, the contralateral anterior cingulate gyrus, and bilateral in the dorsolateral and lateral-orbitofrontal prefrontal cortex.Discussion:Because the prefrontal cortical regions have been shown to be active during dual-task performance, the MRI results converge with the neuropsychological findings of impairment on these tasks. We conclude that HIMAL had no direct memory repercussions, but was secondary to subtle but widespread neurologic abnormalities that also affected morphology and functioning of the prefrontal cortex."

It is, therefore, not surprising that recurrent chromosome 1 abnormalities are regularly encountered in both neoplastic and non-neoplastic medical conditions. The current review is focused on myeloid malignancies where we summarize the relevant published literature and discuss specific karyotype-phenotype associations. We show that chromosome 1 abnormalities are most frequent in BCR-ABL-negative classic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN): polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Specific abnormalities include duplications (e.g. 1q12-->1q32 in PV, 1q21-32-->1q32-44 in post-PV MF or PMF), deletions (e.g. 1p13-36-->pter in PV or PMF, 1q21 in PMF) and unbalanced translocations involving chromosome 6, such as der(6)t(1;6)(q21-25;p21.3-23), and other partner chromosomes involving 1q10/1p11 and 1q21-25 breakpoints. Although occasionally seen in chronic phase MPN, unbalanced 1;7 translocations, e.g. der(1;7)(q10;p10), are usually seen in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and post-MPN AML/MDS. These observations suggest that certain chromosome 1 regions, especially 1q21-1q32 and 1p11-13, might harbor oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes that are pathogenetically relevant to both chronic and advanced phases of MPN."

        "Abstract": "During the past 20 yr, the population of immunocompromized patients at risk of developing invasive fungal infections (IFIs) has increased, and there has been a shift in fungal epidemiology, with more infections caused by non-Aspergillus molds and yeasts, which are often resistant to one or more antifungal drugs. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as culture and the histopathology of infected tissue, often fail to detect IFIs until the later stages. Furthermore, invasive diagnostic methods to obtain tissue may be contraindicated in severely ill patients; even when tissue is available, the morphology of several filamentous fungi is identical, or the cultures may fail to grow the pathogen. Recently developed non-invasive diagnostic techniques, such as tests for serum markers and polymerase chain reaction assays, may allow for earlier and more accurate diagnoses - crucial in the effort to reduce morbidity and the risk of mortality. This article reviews current approaches to diagnosis and treatment, focusing on how an early and accurate diagnosis can guide treatment and improve outcomes. Strategies for improving the management of IFIs also are discussed."

In contrast, apart from MTX, retrospective controls received high-dose CsA, starting at 5-7.5 mg/kg per day i.v. and discontinued 1 yr post-transplant. In the low-dose CsA group, the probability of acute GVHD grades I-II (70% vs. 53%, P < 0.01), and chronic GVHD were increased (58% vs. 25%, P < 0.01), whereas the incidences of acute GVHD grades III-IV (9% vs. 5%, P = 0.62), and non-relapse mortality (20% vs. 22%, P = 0.58) were similar. Moreover, the probability of relapse was decreased (31% vs. 54%, P < 0.01), and both relapse-free (56% vs. 38%, P = 0.04) and overall survival (61% vs. 40%, P = 0.04) were markedly improved using the low-dose CsA regimen. In multivariate analyses, low-dose CsA was strongly associated with chronic GVHD [relative hazard (RH) 2.56, P < 0.01], which decreased the risk of relapse (RH 0.46, P < 0.01) and improved the probability of survival (RH 1.84, P < 0.01). In conclusion, a low-dose CsA regimen in leukaemic recipients of HLA-identical sibling transplants increases the rate of chronic GVHD, which seems to attenuate the risk of relapse, thereby improving patient survival owing to enhanced graft-versus-leukaemia effect."

Using quantitative high-resolution pyrosequencing methodology, KLF11, MAFB, and KLF5 were shown for the first time to be hypermethylated in 17 (15%), 8 (7%), and 2 (1.7%) cases, respectively, but not in any of the patients with an isolated 5q-deletion. Patient samples harbouring KLF11 methylation displayed reduced KLF11 mRNA expression and KLF11 hypermethylation correlated with a high International Prognostic Scoring System score (P < 0.05). In conclusion, epigenetic inactivation and subsequent transcriptional repression of the KLF11 gene is quite frequent in MDS. Patients with an isolated 5q-deletion seem to harbour a distinct epigenetic profile."

We also derived IM-resistant cells, NPhA2/STIR, from NPhA2 under gradually increasing IM concentrations.Results:NPhA1 was sensitive to IM (IC(50) 0.05 microm) and NPhA2 showed mild IM resistance (IC(50) 0.3 microm). NPhA2/STIR could be maintained in the presence of 10 microm IM. Phosphorylation of MEK and ERK was slightly elevated in NPhA2 and significantly elevated in NPhA2/STIR compared to NPhA1 cells. After treatment with IM, phosphorylation of MEK and ERK was not suppressed but rather increased in NPhA2 and NPhA2/STIR. Active RAS was also increased markedly in NPhA2/STIR after IM treatment. The expression of BCL-2 was increased in NPhA2 compared to NPhA1, but no further increase in NPhA2/STIR. Proliferation of NPhA2/STIR was significantly inhibited by a combination of MEK inhibitor and IM. Analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation status with a protein tyrosine kinase array showed increased phosphorylation of EphB4 in NPhA2/STIR after IM treatment. Although transcription of EphB4 was suppressed in NPhA1 and NPhA2 after IM treatment, it was not suppressed and its ligand, ephrinB2, was increased in NPhA2/STIR. Suppression of EphB4 transcripts by introducing short hairpin RNA into NPhA2/STIR partially restored their sensitivity to IM.Conclusions:These results suggest a new mechanism of IM resistance mediated by the activation of RAS/MAPK pathway and EphB4."

Using legumes and rhizobia from three natural populations, I studied the symbiotic fitness benefits for both partners in 108 plant maternal family by rhizobium strain combinations. Genotype-by-genotype (G x G) interactions among local genotypes and among partner populations determined, in part, the benefits of mutualism for both partners; for example, the fitness effects of particular rhizobium strains ranged from uncooperative to mutualistic depending on the plant family. Correlations between plant and rhizobium fitness benefits suggest a trade off, and therefore a potential conflict, between the interests of the two partners. These results suggest that legume-rhizobium mutualisms are dynamic at multiple spatial scales, and that strictly additive models of mutualism benefits may ignore dynamics potentially important to both the maintenance of genetic variation and the generation of geographic patterns in coevolutionary interactions."

        "Abstract": "Explanations for the evolution of polyandry often center on the idea that females garner genetic benefits for their offspring by mating multiply. Furthermore, postcopulatory processes are thought to be fundamental to enabling polyandrous females to screen for genetic quality. Much attention has focused on the potential for polyandrous females to accrue such benefits via a sexy- or good-sperm mechanism, whereby additive variation exists among males in sperm competitiveness. Likewise, attention has focused on an alternative model, in which offspring quality (in this context, the sperm competitiveness of sons) hinges on an interaction between parental haplotypes (genetic compatibility). Sperm competitiveness that is contingent on parental compatibility will exhibit nonadditive genetic variation. We tested these models in the Australian cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus, using a design that allowed us to partition additive, nonadditive genetic, and parental variance for sperm competitiveness. We found an absence of additive and nonadditive genetic variance in this species, challenging the direct relevance of either model to the evolution of sperm competitiveness in particular, and polyandry in general. Instead, we found maternal effects that were possibly sex-linked or cytoplasmically linked. We also found effects of focal male age on sperm competitiveness, with small increments in age conferring more competitive sperm."

We determined the heritability of both female and male promiscuity in the highly promiscuous moth U. ornatrix (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) through parent-offspring and grandparent-offspring regression analyses. Our data show that male promiscuity is not sex-limited and either autosomal or sex-linked whereas female promiscuity is primarily determined by sex-limited, Z-linked genes. These data are consistent with the \"sexy-sperm hypothesis,\" which posits that multiple-mating and sperm competitiveness coevolve through a Fisherian-like process in which female promiscuity is a kind of mate choice in which sperm-competitiveness is the trait favored in males. Such a Fisherian process should also be more potent when female preferences are Z-linked and sex-limited than when autosomal or not limited."

        "Abstract": "In this article, an approach to measure fitness is proposed that considers fitness as a measure of competitive ability among phenotypes or genotypes. This approach is based on pairwise competition tests and is related to measures of \"utility\" in mathematical economics. Extending the results from utility theory it is possible to recover the classical Wrightian fitness measure without reference to models of population growth. A condition, quasi-BTL, similar to the Bradley-Terry-Luce condition of classical utility theory is shown to be necessary for the existence of frequency and context-independent fitness measures. Testing for violations of this quasi-BTL condition can be used to the detect genotype-by-genotype interactions and frequency-dependent fitness. A method for the detection of genotype by environment interactions is proposed that avoids potential scaling artifacts. Furthermore the measurement theoretical approach allows one to derive Wright's selection equation. This shows that classical selection equations are entirely general and exact. It is concluded that measurement theory is able to give definite answers to a number theoretical and practical questions. For instance, this theory identifies the correct scale for measuring gene interaction with respect to fitness and shows that different scales may lead to wrong conclusions."

How does a single morph, well camouflaged in one type of habitat, evolve crypsis in another, not isolated, habitat? We here analyze a model of one prey species living in two different habitats connected by passive dispersal. We find that the rate of dispersal, the trade-off between crypticity in the habitats, and the amount of predation determines whether the prey species can become cryptic in two different habitats through evolutionary branching. Intermediate values of all parameters seem to promote evolutionary branching leading to polymorphism, and a more extreme value of one parameter can be balanced by another. Other parameter combinations lead to either a single habitat specialist or an intermediate generalist type, partly cryptic in both habitats. When the predator follows a type III functional response, the parameter space for when the prey will undergo evolutionary branching is remarkably larger than the corresponding parameter space for a type II functional response. Evolutionary branching can occur both at the intermediate generalist strategy, or close to a specialist strategy."

In this study, we used the three-spot dascyllus (Dascyllus trimaculatus) species complex to evaluate speciation modes at the spatial scale of the Indo-Pacific. The complex includes four recognized species and four main color morphs that differ in distribution. Previous studies of the group using mitochondrial DNA revealed a noncongruence between color morphs and genetic groupings; with two of the color morphs grouped together and one color morph separated into three clades. Using extensive geographic sampling of 563 individuals and a combination of mitochondrial DNA sequences and 13 nuclear microsatellites, we defined population/species boundaries and inferred different speciation modes. The complex is composed of seven genetically distinct entities, some of which are distinct morphologically. Despite extensive dispersal abilities and an apparent lack of barriers, observed genetic partitions are consistent with allopatric speciation. However, ecological pressure, assortative mating, and sexual selection, were likely important during periods of geographical isolation. This study therefore suggests that primarily historical factors later followed by ecological factors caused divergence and speciation in this group of coral reef fish."

In contrast, when individuals are constrained to define their condition absolutely, environmental fluctuations induce fluctuating sex ratios and the evolutionary loss of condition-dependent sex allocation in short-lived organisms. Here, we present a simulation model of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in fluctuating environments that specifically examines the importance of relativity in defining individual condition. When relativity in condition is allowed to evolve, short-lived organisms evolve switchlike TSD reaction norms and define their condition relative to the annual temperature distribution, thus preventing biased cohort sex ratios in extreme years. Long-lived organisms also evolve switchlike reaction norms, but define condition less relatively and experience biased cohort sex ratios. The predictions are supported by data from painted turtles, where TSD reaction norms exhibit pivotal temperatures of sex determination that partially track mean annual temperature. Examining relativity in amniotic vertebrates provides a conceptual framework for multifactorial sex determination and suggests new ways of exploring adaptive hypotheses of sex allocation by focusing on the importance of frequency-dependent selection on sex."

Abstract: Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is a member of the ATF/cyclic AMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB) family of transcription factors and is involved in the regulation of immune responses, apoptosis, DNA repair and oncogenesis. The epidermal expression of ATF3 in the setting of cutaneous inflammation has not been well characterized. To examine the expression of ATF3 in the setting of inflammatory skin disease, ATF3 protein expression was analysed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). We found diffuse epidermal ATF3 protein expression in skin biopsies of erythema multiforme (EM). Given the role of interferon (IFN)-gamma in erythema multiforme, we sought to examine the impact of IFN-gamma on ATF3 expression in human keratinocytes. IFN-gamma induced ATF3 mRNA and protein in primary human keratinocytes and HaCaT cells. Thus, epidermal ATF3 expression can be increased in the setting of inflammatory skin diseases and is regulated by IFN-gamma in human keratinocytes."

At the interface between different materials, electrons are localized heterogeneously and induce electrical potential. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of metals on the barrier recovery. When we put pure gold plate on skin immediately after tape stripping, the barrier recovery rate was faster than the control. The acceleration of barrier recovery was blocked when the plate was earthed (grounded). When a plastic membrane was sandwiched between the plate and the skin, the recovery was delayed in comparison with the control. We then used a germanium diode to regulate the current flow between the plate and the earth. When the current was blocked, the barrier recovery was accelerated, but when the current was not blocked, the recovery was not accelerated. These results suggest that localization of electron might affect for the barrier recovery rate. The level of interfacial electric potential would be different due to the electrochemical property of metal. Thus, we next evaluated the effects of other metals. With samarium, zirconium, iridium and silver, the barrier recovery rate was faster than in the case of gold, while a platinum plate induced slower recovery than in the case of gold. There was a significant correlation between work function of each metal and barrier recovery rate. These results suggest that electron donation from outside accelerated the skin barrier recovery."

Neurofibromas arise from Schwann cells with biallelic inactivation of NF1, the gene that encodes neurofibromin. This protein is responsible for regulation of the Ras-mediated pathway, which has been shown to play a crucial role in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is a biological process that occurs during embryogenesis and wound healing and is involved in pathological processes such as organ fibrosis and cancer metastasis. However, the relationship between neurofibromin and EMT has not been elucidated. We investigated whether the EMT-related signaling pathway was upregulated in NF1-associated neurofibromas and Schwann cells by assessing the expression levels of the EMT-related transcription factors Snail, Slug, Twist, ZEB1 and ZEB2. Immunohistochemical studies and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed an increase in the expression levels of EMT-related transcription factors in neurofibroma specimens and NF1-derived Schwann cells (sNF96.2). In addition, the silencing of NF1 by siRNA induced the expression of EMT-related transcription factors in normal human Schwann cells and in epithelial-like breast cancer cells. Our findings suggest that the loss of neurofibromin activated the EMT-related signaling pathway and that the excessive mesenchymal reaction may play a key role in the development of NF1-associated neurofibromas."

        "Abstract": "UVA radiation is increasingly used to treat fibrotic skin disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of UVA for these disorders are only partially understood. Cathepsin L is a lysosomal cysteine protease, which has been shown to degrade various matrix proteins thus contributing to extracellular remodeling. Therefore, we investigated whether UVA irradiation regulates the expression and release of cathepsin L in human dermal fibroblasts. No alterations were found after single irradiation; however, a significantly increased extracellular release of cathepsin L was observed after repeated irradiation up to four times. The transcript levels of cathepsin L were elevated after repetitive irradiation, leading to increased amounts of total cathepsin L protein. Furthermore, higher amounts of extracellular cathepsin L were associated with a significant reduction of intracellular processed cathepsin L and an accumulation of unprocessed procathepsin L. The use of specific inhibitors elucidated mannose phosphate-independent sorting pathways of cathepsin L leading to enhanced secretion and reduced intracellular processing. This is the first study which demonstrates that alternate trafficking mechanisms mediate the extracellular release of a cysteine protease induced by repetitive UVA irradiation."

        "Abstract": "Connexin 26 is important in keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation and skin pathologies. Cx26 is barely expressed in normal adult epidermis, but its expression is induced during wound healing, psoriasis, and skin hyperplasia stimulated by tumor promoters. In hyperplastic proliferating epidermis, Cx26 is co-expressed with Cx43 typical for basal and suprabasal keratinocytes. As Cx26 and Cx43 can not form permeable gap junctions, their co-expression may alter the gap junctional communication between keratinocytes and induce proliferation. To test the effect of persistent co-expression of Cx26 and Cx43 in epidermis, we generated transgenic mice using keratin5 promoter to target Cx26 to basal Cx43-positive keratinocytes. We evaluated the effect of ectopic Cx26 on keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation in normal and 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-treated skin. The ectopic Cx26 expression in epidermis did not significantly affect skin development, keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation in newborn and adult skin. Unexpectedly, the proliferative effect of tumor promoter TPA was strongly decreased in epidermis of K5.Cx26 transgenics. This correlated with significant down-regulation of TPA-induced activity of protein kinase C (PKC) in K5.Cx26 mice."

It is reasonable to speculate that the dysfunctional activity of psoriatic T cells may partly originate from the abnormal haematopoietic cells.Objectives:To test if T cells originated from haematopoietic progenitor cells in psoriasis patients display functional alternations similar to previously reported abnormalities of circulating T cells.Methods:Bone marrow CD34(+) haematopoietic cells were isolated from psoriatic patients with family history and healthy subjects, and differentiated into T cells in vitro in the thymic stromal co-culture system. These cells were further subjected to functional comparisons such as in vitro proliferation, secretion of cytokines such as IL-4, IL-8 and IFN-gamma, and inducing the production of C-myc, Bcl-xL, and Ki67 proteins in human keratinocytes.Results:While bone marrow-derived CD34(+) cells from both patients and healthy volunteers developed into mature T cells within weeks in the thymic environment in vitro, the differentiated T cells from psoriatic patients showed higher proliferation and stronger capacity to secret TH1 cytokines in response to streptococcal superantigen. The differentiated T cells from psoriatic patients, but not from normal controls, induced overexpression of C-myc and Ki67, but not Bcl-XL, in keratinocytes.Conclusions:T cells differentiated from CD34(+) cells of psoriatic patients, but not normal controls, are functionally similar to psoriatic circulating T cells, suggesting that the dysfunctional activity of T cells in psoriatic patients can be traced back to the early development of haematopoietic cells."

We identified additional phenotypic differences between infections with these two organisms. MAF patients were more likely to be older and HIV infected. In addition, they had worse disease on chest X-ray, despite complaining of cough for an equal duration, and were more likely severely malnourished. In this cohort, the prevalence of MAF did not change significantly over a 7-year period."

Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses yielded 549 distinct RFLP patterns, 268 of which could be assigned to fungi (Dikarya and zygomycetes) after sequence analyses. The remaining 281 RFLP patterns represented a variety of nonfungal taxa, even when using putatively fungal-specific primers. A substantial number of fungal sequences were closely related to environmental sequences from a range of other anoxic marine habitats, but distantly related to known sequences of described fungi. Community similarity analyses suggested distinctively different structures of fungal communities from normoxic sites, seasonally anoxic sites and permanently anoxic sites, suggesting different adaptation strategies of fungal communities to prevailing oxygen conditions. Additionally, we obtained 26 fungal cultures from the study sites, most of which were closely related (>97% sequence similarity) to well-described Dikarya. This indicates that standard cultivation mainly produces more of what is already known. However, two of these cultures were highly divergent to known sequences and seem to represent novel fungal groups on high taxonomic levels. Interestingly, none of the cultured isolates is identical to any of the environmental sequences obtained. Our study demonstrates the importance of a multiple-primer approach combined with cultivation to obtain deeper insights into the true fungal diversity in environmental samples and to enable adequate intersample comparisons of fungal communities."

However, little is known about the gastrointestinal microbiota of dogs with chronic diarrhoea and controlled canine studies of dietary management are scarce. The aims of this study were to investigate the predominant faecal microbiota of chronic diarrhoea dogs and to examine the effect(s) of a fibre blend on the canine faecal microbiota. A 3-week fibre supplementation feeding study was performed in nine chronic diarrhoea and eight control dogs. Atopobium cluster, Lactobacillus-Enterococcus group and Clostridium cluster XIV were the predominant bacterial groups in all dogs. Chronic diarrhoea dogs had significantly higher Bacteroides counts at baseline and significantly lower Atopobium cluster counts following fibre supplementation compared with control dogs. Atopobium cluster levels increased significantly in control dogs, while counts of sulphate-reducing bacteria decreased significantly and Clostridium clusters I and II counts increased significantly in chronic diarrhoea dogs during fibre supplementation. Microbial profiles (detected by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) demonstrated interindividual variation, with greater similarity seen between the chronic diarrhoea and control dogs' profiles after fibre supplementation compared with baseline. In conclusion, fibre supplementation induced changes in the canine faecal microbiota, with greater resemblance between the microbiota of chronic diarrhoea and control dogs after this dietary modulation."

        "Abstract": "Acetate is the most important intermediate in anaerobic degradation of organic matter. The carbon isotope effects associated with the oxidation of acetate (epsilon(ac)) were examined for four acetotrophic sulfur reducers, Desulfuromonas acetoxidans, Desulfuromonas thiophila, Desulfurella acetivorans, and Hippea maritima. During the consumption of acetate and sulfur, acetate was enriched in (13)C by 11.5 and 11.2 per thousand in Desulfuromonas acetoxidans and Desulfuromonas thiophila, respectively. By contrast, isotope fractionation in D. acetivorans and H. maritima resulted in isotope enrichment factors of epsilon(ac)=-6.3 per thousand and -8.4 per thousand, respectively. These sulfur-reducing bacteria all metabolize acetate via the tricarboxylic acid cycle, but have different mechanisms for the initial activation of acetate. In Desulfuromonas acetoxidans, acetyl-CoA is formed by succinyl-CoA : acetate-CoA-transferase, and in D. acetivorans by acetate kinase and phosphate acetyltransferase. Hence, values of epsilon(ac) seem to be characteristic for the type of activation of acetate to acetyl-CoA in acetotrophic sulfur reducers. Summarizing epsilon(ac)-values in anaerobic acetotrophic microorganisms, it appears that isotope fractionation depends on the mechanism of acetate activation to acetyl-CoA, on the key enzyme of the acetate dissimilation pathway, and on the bioavailability of acetate, which all have to be considered when using delta(13)C of acetate in environmental samples for diagnosis of the involved microbial populations."

After 4-7 days of exposure to amoxicillin, fecal Escherichia coli expressed resistance to multiple antibiotics when compared with the pre-exposure situation. Two weeks postexposure, the susceptibility pattern had returned to pre-exposure levels in most dogs. A shift in bacterial populations was confirmed by molecular fingerprinting of fecal bacterial populations using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) of the 16S V3 rRNA gene region. Much of the variation in DGGE profiles could be attributed to dog-specific factors. However, permutation tests indicated that amoxicillin exposure significantly affected the DGGE profiles after controlling for the dog effect (P=0.02), and pre-exposure samples were clearly separated from postexposure samples. Sequence analysis of DGGE bands and real-time PCR quantification indicated that amoxicillin exposure caused a shift in the intestinal ecological balance toward a Gram-negative microbiota including resistant species in the family Enterobacteriaceae."

        "Abstract": "Soil represents a very heterogeneous environment for its microbiota. Among the soil inhabitants, bacteria and fungi are important organisms as they are involved in key biogeochemical cycling processes. A main energy source driving the system is formed by plants through the provision of plant-fixed (reduced) carbon to the soil, whereas soil nitrogen and phosphorus may move from the soil back to the plant. The carbonaceous compounds released form the key energy and nutrient sources for the soil microbiota. In the grossly carbon-limited soil, the emergence of plant roots and the formation of their associated mycorrhizae thus create nutritional hot spots for soil-dwelling bacteria. As there is natural (fitness) selection on bacteria in the soil, those bacteria that are best able to benefit from the hot spots have probably been selected. The purpose of this review is to examine the interactions of bacteria with soil fungi in these hot spots and to highlight the key mechanisms involved in the selection of fungal-responsive bacteria. Salient bacterial mechanisms that are involved in these interactions have emerged from this examination. Thus, the efficient acquisition for specific released nutrients, the presence of type-III secretion systems and the capacity of flagellar movement and to form a biofilm are pinpointed as key aspects of bacterial life in the mycosphere. The possible involvement of functions present on plasmid-borne genes is also interrogated."

Multilocus sequence analysis using five housekeeping genes (rpoA, pyrH, topA, ftsZ and mreB) showed that the strains form a monophyletic group with 94.4% concatenated sequence identity to the closest species. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments showed that strains DY05(T) and 47666-1 had 76% DNA similarity to each other, but <70% to their closest neighbours Vibrio harveyi LMG 4044(T) (< or =55%), Vibrio campbellii LMG 11216(T) (< or =52%) and Vibrio rotiferianus LMG 21460(T) (< or =46%).

The major fatty acids were C(15:0) iso 2-OH and/or C(16:1)omega7, C(16:0), C(18:1)omega7 and C(14:0). Based on the polyphasic evidence presented here, it can be concluded that strains DY05(T) and 47666-1 belong to the same novel species of the genus Vibrio, for which the name Vibrio owensii sp. nov. is proposed.

We constructed a P. gingivalis strain that expresses histidine-tagged Sov instead of Sov. Subcellular fractionations and a histidine-tag pulldown experiment showed that histidine-tagged Sov was present in an outer membrane fraction. Furthermore, antiserum raised against the terminal regions of Sov obstructed the secretion of Arg-gingipains from wild-type W83 cells. A deletion study showed that the region from Phe2495 to the C-terminus Gln2499 of Sov is essential for gingipain secretion. Anti-histidine-tag immunoglobulins interfered with the secretion of Arg-gingipains by P. gingivalis cells that expressed histidine-tagged Sov. In conclusion, we found that Sov is an outer membrane protein participating in the secretion of gingipains and that the C-terminal region of Sov is exposed to the extracellular milieu and involved in the modulation of Sov function."

In this study, we identified five putative carotenoid biosynthetic genes from the ascomycete Gibberella zeae (GzCarB, GzCarO, GzCarRA, GzCarT, and GzCarX). HPLC showed that the fungus produces two carotenoids: neurosporaxanthin and torulene. We deleted the five genes individually to determine their functions. GzCarB, GzCarRA, and GzCarT were required for neurosporaxanthin biosynthesis, but the deletion of GzCarX or GzCarO (DeltagzcarX or DeltagzcarO) failed to alter the production of neurosporaxanthin or torulene. DeltagzcarRA and DeltagzcarB did not produce neurosporaxanthin or torulene. DeltagzcarB led to the accumulation of phytoene, which is an intermediate in carotenoid biosynthesis, but DeltagzcarRA did not. DeltagzcarT produced torulene but not neurosporaxanthin. Based on these functional studies and similarities to carotenoid biosynthesis genes in other fungi, we deduced the functions of the three genes and propose the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway of G. zeae."

Blocking contact between lactobacilli and immune cells abrogated all cytokine production. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) was partially responsible, but not TLR4 or TLR9, for the induction of cytokine production in splenocytes. All cytokine production declined to basal levels when bacterial phagocytosis was inhibited. This shows that lactobacilli stimulation of cytokine production in splenocytes requires the process of phagocytosis and engagement of TLR2, but not TLR4 or TLR9."

        "Abstract": "Yersinia pestis PsaA is an adhesin important for the establishment of bacterial infection. PsaA synthesis requires the products of the psaEFABC genes. Here, by prediction analysis, we identified a PsaA signal sequence with two signal peptidase (SPase) cleavage sites, type-I and type-II (SPase-I and SPase-II). By Edman degradation and site-directed mutagenesis, the precise site for one of these Spase-I PsaA cleavage sites was located between alanine and serine at positions 31 and 32, respectively. Yersinia pestis psaA expression and the role of the PsaB and PsaC proteins were evaluated in recombinant attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium vaccine strains. PsaA was detected in total extracts as a major 15-kDa (mature) and 18-kDa (unprocessed) protein bands. PsaA synthesis was not altered by a DeltaA31-DeltaS32 double-deletion mutation. In contrast, the synthesis of PsaA (DeltaA31-DeltaS32) in Y. pestis and delivery to the supernatant was decreased. Otherwise, substitution of the amino acid cysteine at position 26 by valine involved in the SPase-II cleavage site did not show any effect on the secretion of PsaA in Salmonella and Yersinia. These results help clarify the secretion pathway of PsaA for the possible development of vaccines against Y. pestis."

The mutant was shown to be permanently under oxidative stress, based on fluorophore oxidation, and also to be sensitive to tert-butyl hydroperoxide and paraquat. However, the results showed that the activities of superoxide dismutases CuZnSOD and FeSOD and the alkylhydroperoxide reductase ahpC mRNA levels in the rho mutant were comparable to the wild-type control in the exponential and stationary phases. In contrast, the KatG catalase activity of the rho mutant strain was drastically decreased and did not show the expected increase in the stationary phase compared with the exponential phase. Transcription of the katG gene was increased in the rho mutant and the levels of the immunoreactive KatG protein do not differ considerably compared with the wild type in the stationary phase, suggesting that KatG activity is affected in a translational or a post-translational step."

TA1, isolated from an alkaline spa, can grow on several aromatic compounds such as ferulic acid, vanillin, vanillic acid, and protocatechuic acid under alkaline conditions. The neutrophile Burkholderia cepacia TM1, which was isolated previously, also grew on the above-mentioned compounds because they functioned as the sole carbon source under neutral conditions. Purified VDHs showed activities toward some aromatic aldehydes. These enzymes have the same subunit molecular mass of about 57 kDa as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but differed in some of their observed properties. Native molecular masses also differed between the purified enzymes. These were 250 kDa for the enzyme from alkaliphilic strain TA1 and 110 kDa for that from neutrophilic strain TM1, as determined by gel filtration. The enzyme from strain TA1 required NADP(+) as a coenzyme for its activity, but that from strain TM1 required NAD(+). These results are important because this is the first report of an alkaliphilic bacterium consuming lignin monomers."

ZFF from Phytophthora nicotianae, Phytophthora sojae, and Pythium aphanidermatum triggered luminescence of the Vibrio harve7yi AI-2 reporter, indicating the presence of AI-2 in zoospore extracellular products and the potential of cross-kingdom communication between oomycetes and bacteria. The production of AI-2 by zoospores was confirmed by chemical assays. These results provide a new insight into the physiology and ecology of oomycetes."

BinA is important for toxicity, whereas BinB acts as a specific receptor-binding component. To study the functional significance of two regions that are only present in BinB, four block mutations and two single mutations were initially introduced: (111)YLD(113)-->(111)AAA(113), (115)NNH(117)-->(115)AAA(117), (143)GEQ(145)-->(143)AAA(145), (147)FQFY(150)-->(147)AAAA(150), N114A and F146A. Only the replacements at (147)FQFY(150) resulted in a total loss of toxicity to Culex quinquefasciatus larvae. Further single alanine substitutions in this region, F147A, Q148A, F149A and Y150A, were introduced to identify residues playing a critical role in mosquito-larvicidal activity. Larvicidal activity assays revealed that only F149A and Y150A mutants exhibited a total loss of toxicity. The in vitro interaction assays demonstrated that all BinB mutants are able to interact with BinA. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that only the Y150A mutant was unable to bind to the larval midgut, suggesting an important role of this residue in receptor binding of the BinB subunit. Conservative aromatic substitutions at F149 and Y150 resulted in full recovery of larvicidal activity, indicating that the aromaticity of F149 and Y150 is a key determinant of larvicidal activity, possibly playing a key role in the membrane interaction and receptor binding."

Both ligands interacted with the globular domain of Scl1, which is also able to bind the low-density lipoprotein. Native Scl1 mediated GAS adherence to ligand-coated glass cover slips and promoted GAS internalization into HEp-2 cells. This work identifies new ligands of the Scl1 protein that are known to be important in GAS pathogenesis and suggests a novel ligand-switching mechanism between blood and tissue environments, thereby facilitating host colonization and GAS dissemination."

However, a significant proportion of users suffer symptoms of myotoxicity, and currently, the molecular mechanisms underlying myotoxicity remain ambiguous. In this study, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was exploited as a model system to gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms of atorvastatin toxicity. Atorvastatin-treated yeast cells display marked morphological deformities, have reduced cell viability and are highly vulnerable to perturbed mitochondrial function. Supplementation assays of atorvastatin-treated cells reveal that both loss of viability and mitochondrial dysfunction occur as a consequence of perturbation of the sterol synthesis pathway. This was further investigated by supplementing statin-treated cells with various metabolites of the sterol synthesis pathway that are believed to be essential for cell function. Ergosterol, coenzyme Q and a heme precursor were all ineffective in the prevention of statin-induced mitochondrial disruption and cell death. However, the addition of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate significantly restored cell viability, although these did not overcome petite induction. This highlights the pleiotropic nature of statin toxicity, but has established protein prenylation disruption as one of the principal mechanisms underlying statin-induced cell death in yeast."

Formamidases hydrolyze formamide, putatively plays a role in fungal nitrogen metabolism. An abundant 45-kDa protein was identified as the P. brasiliensis formamidase. In this study, recombinant formamidase was overexpressed in bacteria and a polyclonal antibody to this protein was produced. We identified a 180-kDa protein species reactive to the antibody produced in mice against the P. brasiliensis recombinant purified formamidase of 45 kDa. The 180-kDa purified protein yielded a heat-denatured species of 45 kDa. Both protein species of 180 and 45 kDa were identified as formamidase by peptide mass fingerprinting using MS. The identical mass spectra generated by the 180 and the 45-kDa protein species indicated that the fungal formamidase is most likely homotetrameric in its native conformation. Furthermore, the purified formamidase migrated as a protein of 191 kDa in native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, thus revealing that the enzyme forms a homotetrameric structure in its native state. This enzyme is present in the fungus cytoplasm and the cell wall. Use of a yeast two-hybrid system revealed cell wall membrane proteins, in addition to cytosolic proteins interacting with formamidase. These data provide new insights into formamidase structure as well as potential roles for formamidase and its interaction partners in nitrogen metabolism."

Analysis of purified recombinant proteins demonstrated that both cytochromes undergo rapid electron exchange with FH in vitro with MtrC displaying faster transfer rates than OmcA. Immunomicroscopy with cytochrome-specific antibodies revealed that MtrC co-localizes with iron solids on the cell surface while OmcA exhibits a more diffuse distribution over the cell surface. After 3-day incubation of MR-1 with FH, pronounced reductive transformation mineral products were visible by electron microscopy. Upon further incubation, the predominant phases identified were ferrous phosphates including vivianite [Fe(3)(PO(4))(2)x8H(2)O] and a switzerite-like phase [Mn(3),Fe(3)(PO(4))(2)x7H(2)O] that were heavily colonized by MR-1 cells with surface-exposed outer-membrane cytochromes. In the absence of both MtrC and OmcA, the cells ability to reduce FH was significantly hindered and no mineral transformation products were detected. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of the outer-membrane cytochromes in the reductive transformation of FH and support a role for direct electron transfer from the OMCs at the cell surface to the mineral."

The polypill, a multi-component tablet or capsule designed to reduce several cardiovascular causal risk factors simultaneously, has the potential to reduce the incidence of heart attacks and stroke by about 80%, the precise reduction depending on the formulation of the polypill and adherence to preventive treatment. The full public health impact can only be realized if the polypill is used to prevent first cardiovascular disease events, because most heart attacks and strokes are first events. A simple and effective method of selecting who should be offered the polypill is needed. Even though serum cholesterol and blood pressure are important causes of CHD and stroke and lowering them has a large preventive effect (a 1.8 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol reduces the incidence of CHD events by about 60% and a 10 mmHg reduction in diastolic blood pressure also reduces the incidence of stroke by about 60%), they are poor screening tests. They add little to age in discriminating between individuals who will and will not have a CHD event or stroke. Including them in a risk assessment algorithm needlessly complicates the screening process and tends to medicalize the preventive strategy. Age alone is effective and a simpler means of selecting people for preventive treatment using the polypill."

This behavior is defined as a form of associative learning, in which temperature pairs with the presence or absence of food. Different interpretations have been drawn from the diverse results obtained by several groups, mainly because of the application of different methodologies for the analysis of thermotaxis. To clarify the discrepancies in behavioral observations and subsequent interpretations by different laboratories, we attempted to systematize several parameters to observe thermotaxis behavior as originally defined by Hedgecock and Russell in 1975. In this study, we show clearly how C. elegans can show a conditioned migration toward colder or warmer areas on a thermal gradient, given certain criteria necessary for the observation of thermotaxis. We thus propose to distinguish thermotaxis from other temperature-related behaviors, such as the warm avoidance response displayed at temperature gradients of 1 degrees C/cm and steeper."

Both childhood maltreatment and genes underlie vulnerability to suicidal behaviors, possibly by affecting the constitution of intermediate phenotypes such as anger traits. The aim of this study was to test the interaction between nine candidate genes and childhood maltreatment in modulating anger-related traits in 875 adult suicide attempters. The State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire were used to examine anger traits and traumatic childhood experiences, respectively. The functional polymorphism of the catecholamine-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) gene Val158Met significantly modulated the association between sexual abuse and anger-trait level (P = 0.001). In the presence of sexual abuse, individuals carrying the Val high-activity allele displayed greater disposition toward anger than individuals homozygous for the Met allele (P = 0.0003). Notably, none of the serotonin-related genes influenced the effect of childhood abuse on anger traits. The results of the present study suggest that anger-trait level is influenced by the interaction between childhood abuse and functional polymorphism in the COMT gene. This study was carried out in a population with a high frequency of childhood abuse and a high disposition toward anger, and replication in healthy subjects is needed."

Individual vulnerability for this nonadaptive behavior may be determined by an interaction of genetic and environmental factors with the sensitivity of alcohol's effects on brain and behavior. We used a previously established protocol for alcohol oral self-administration and characterized alcohol-heightened aggressive (AHA) mice as compared with alcohol non-heightened (ANA) counterparts. A week later, we quantified mRNA steady state levels of several candidate genes in the serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] system in different brain areas. We report a regionally selective and significant reduction of all 5-HT receptor subtype transcripts, except for 5-HT(3), in the prefrontal cortex of AHA mice. Comparable gene expression profile was previously observed in aggressive mice induced by social isolation or by an anabolic androgenic steroid. Additional change in the 5-HT(1B) receptor transcripts was seen in the amygdala and hypothalamus of AHA mice. In both these areas, 5-HT(1B) mRNA was elevated when compared with ANA mice. In the hypothalamus, AHA mice also showed increased transcripts for 5-HT(2A) receptor. In the midbrain, 5-HT synthetic enzyme, 5-HT transporter and 5-HT receptors mRNA levels were similar between groups. Our results emphasize a role for postsynaptic over presynaptic 5-HT receptors in mice which showed escalated aggression after the consumption of a moderate dose of alcohol. This gene expression profile of 5-HT neurotransmission components in the brain of mice may suggest a vulnerability trait for alcohol-heightened aggression."

To further validate this model, we have extended both behavioral and biochemical analyses in these animals. We found that vertical movements decline earlier and faster than horizontal movements, possibly modeling the early occurrence of axial, postural instability in PD. L-DOPA induces different locomotor responses depending on the age: in young MitoPark mice the L-DOPA-induced motor activation is small; middle-aged MitoPark mice respond in a dose-dependent manner to L-DOPA, whereas aged MitoPark mice display a double-peaked locomotor response to a high dose of L-DOPA that includes an intermittent period of very low motor activity, similar to the 'on-off' phenomenon in PD. To correlate behavior with biochemical data, we analyzed monoamine levels in three different brain areas that are highly innervated by the DA system: striatum, anterior cortex and olfactory bulb. DA levels declined earlier and faster in striatum than in cortex; only at the latest time-point analyzed, DA levels were found to be significantly lower than control levels in the olfactory bulb. Interestingly, the ratio between homovanillic acid (HVA) and DA differed between regions over time. In striatum and olfactory bulb, the ratio increased steeply indicating increased DA turnover. In contrast, the ratio decreased over time in cortex, revealing important differences between DA cells in substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area."

The biological mechanisms by which APOE genotype affects cognitive processes or AD pathogenesis remain unclear, but interactions of apoE with amyloid beta peptide (A beta) are thought to play an important role in mediating apoE's isoform-specific effects on brain function. Here, we investigated the potential isoform-dependent effects of apoE on behavioral and cognitive performance in human apoE3 and apoE4 targeted-replacement (TR) mice that also overexpress the human amyloid precursor protein (APP). Beginning at 6-7 months of age, female APP-Yac/apoE3-TR ('poE3') and APP-Yac/apoE4-TR ('poE4') mice were tested on a battery of tests to evaluate basic sensorimotor functioning, spatial working memory, spatial recognition, episodic-like memory and attentional processing. Compared with apoE3 mice, a generalized reduction in locomotor activity was observed in apoE4 mice. Moderate, but significant, cognitive impairments were also detected in apoE4 mice in the novel object-location preference task, the contextual fear conditioning test, and a two-choice visual discrimination/detection test, however spontaneous alternation performance in the Y-maze was spared. These results offer additional support for the negative impact of apoE4 on both memory and attention and further suggest that APP-Yac/apoE-TR mice provide a novel and useful model for investigating the role of apoE in mediating susceptibility to cognitive decline."

        "Abstract": "A culture-independent community census was combined with chemical and thermodynamic analyses of three springs located within the Long Valley Caldera, Little Hot Creek (LHC) 1, 3, and 4. All three springs were approximately 80 degrees C, circumneutral, apparently anaerobic and had similar water chemistries. 16S rRNA gene libraries constructed from DNA isolated from spring sediment revealed moderately diverse but highly novel microbial communities. Over half of the phylotypes could not be grouped into known taxonomic classes. Bacterial libraries from LHC1 and LHC3 were predominantly species within the phyla Aquificae and Thermodesulfobacteria, while those from LHC4 were dominated by candidate phyla, including OP1 and OP9. Archaeal libraries from LHC3 contained large numbers of Archaeoglobales and Desulfurococcales, while LHC1 and LHC4 were dominated by Crenarchaeota unaffiliated with known orders. The heterogeneity in microbial populations could not easily be attributed to measurable differences in water chemistry, but may be determined by availability of trace amounts of oxygen to the spring sediments. Thermodynamic modeling predicted the most favorable reactions to be sulfur and nitrate respirations, yielding 40-70 kJ mol(-1) e(-) transferred; however, levels of oxygen at or below our detection limit could result in aerobic respirations yielding up to 100 kJ mol(-1) e(-) transferred. Important electron donors are predicted to be H(2), H(2)S, S(0), Fe(2+) and CH(4), all of which yield similar energies when coupled to a given electron acceptor. The results indicate that springs associated with the Long Valley Caldera contain microbial populations that show some similarities both to springs in Yellowstone and springs in the Great Basin."

A retention system was manufactured with an attachment (UCLA) screwed into the implant with a two-bar system that was cast in metallic silver palladium. A substructure made from heat-cured acrylic resin was joined to the retention system by clips to join the thumb to the finger (bar clip) in the cast with implant rejoinder. The silicone material, Silastic-MDX 44210, was used to achieve function and aesthetics. Following osseointegration, no skin problems were observed. Whilst the implant-retained digital prosthesis presented some motor limitations, it allowed the patient to return to entertainment and achieve social conviviality."

        "Abstract": "When seeking to predict plume geometry resulting from fluid injection through partially penetrating wells, it is common to assume a steady-state spherically diverging flow field. In reality, the flow field is transient. The steady-flow assumption is likely to cause overestimation of injection plume radius since the accommodation of fluid by increases in porosity and fluid density is ignored. In this paper, a transient solution is developed, resulting in a nonlinear ordinary differential equation expressing plume radius as a function of time. It is shown that the problem can be fully described by one type curve. A critical time, t(c), is identified at which the percentage error of the steady-state flow solution compared to the fully dynamic problem is less than 1%. Only for large injection rates and low permeabilities, does t(c) become greater than 1 h. Nevertheless, an improved approximate solution is obtained by a simple linearization procedure. The critical time, t(c) for the new approximate solution is 0.3% of that required for the steady-state flow solution."

        "Abstract": "A new method was developed for conducting aquifer tests in fractured-rock flow systems that have a pump-and-treat (P&T) operation for containing and removing groundwater contaminants. The method involves temporary shutdown of individual pumps in wells of the P&T system. Conducting aquifer tests in this manner has several advantages, including (1) no additional contaminated water is withdrawn, and (2) hydraulic containment of contaminants remains largely intact because pumping continues at most wells. The well-shutdown test method was applied at the former Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC), West Trenton, New Jersey, where a P&T operation is designed to contain and remove trichloroethene and its daughter products in the dipping fractured sedimentary rocks underlying the site. The detailed site-scale subsurface geologic stratigraphy, a three-dimensional MODFLOW model, and inverse methods in UCODE_2005 were used to analyze the shutdown tests. In the model, a deterministic method was used for representing the highly heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity distribution and simulations were conducted using an equivalent porous media method. This approach was very successful for simulating the shutdown tests, contrary to a common perception that flow in fractured rocks must be simulated using a stochastic or discrete fracture representation of heterogeneity. Use of inverse methods to simultaneously calibrate the model to the multiple shutdown tests was integral to the effectiveness of the approach."

        "Abstract": "The increasing impetus to provide an effective response to childhood obesity has generated a corresponding concern that weight management interventions may lead to emotional problems among young people, notably in relation to the development of a negative body image. However, currently the processes and factors that contribute to the acquisition of body image among young people is poorly understood. Drawing on salutogenic theory, this paper employs an assets-based approach that focuses on health promoting and protective factors to identify how young people may create or sustain positive body images. Secondary data analysis was undertaken from the WHO Health Behaviour in School Aged Children Study. During the spring term of 2002, information was collected from 6425 English adolescents aged 11-15 using a self-administered questionnaire. The data were analysed using stepwise multinomial logistic regression to determine which factors were associated with positive body image; a total of 2898 students were included in the final analysis. Adolescents who self-identified as having a positive body image were more likely to report ease of talking with a father figure, feeling intelligent, perceiving that their family were well off and a belief that their teachers were interested in them as people. Body Mass Index, age, gender and living within a household containing a father were also significant predictors of body image. The discussion provides an exploration of how the construction of young people's emotional health is in part linked with the attainment of a secure and positive body image. The implications for health promotion and educational programmes are then examined. By considering the assets, which support or sustain a positive body image during adolescence, obesity prevention programmes could be better tailored to meet the needs of young people. In the future, a salutogenic curriculum might provide an alternative to unsustainable levels of deficit led, targeted programmes."

Dendritic cells (DCs) are a functionally diverse cell type and represent the most potent antigen-presenting cells of the immune system. In this study, we investigated resveratrol-induced effects on DCs during their differentiation and maturation. Our results show that resveratrol induces DC-associated tolerance, particularly when applied during DC differentiation. Costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD86 were down-regulated, as was the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. Surface expression of inhibitory immunoglobulin-like transcript 3 (ILT3) and ILT4 molecules was induced, while human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-G expression was not affected. Resveratrol-treated DCs lost the ability to produce interleukin (IL)-12p70 after activation, but had an increased ability to produce IL-10. Such DCs were poor stimulators of allogeneic T cells and had lowered ability to induce CD4(+) T-cell migration. Furthermore, treated cells were able to generate allogeneic IL-10-secreting T cells, but were not competent in inducing FoxP3 expression These tolerogenic effects are probably associated with the effect of resveratrol on multiple molecular targets through which it interferes with DC differentiation and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB translocation. Our data provide new insights into the molecular and functional mechanisms of the tolerogenic effects that resveratrol exerts on DCs."

We hypothesized that heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) isolated from CD4(+) T cells may act as a chaperone and carry the protective host proteins. Two moieties of HSP70 were affinity-purified from human CD4(+) T cells; an ADP preparation with HSP70-bound proteins (ADP-HSP) and an ATP control preparation. Immunization of rhesus macaques with these preparations showed significant inhibition of SIVmac251 infectivity ex vivo in CD4(+) T cells only with the ADP-HSP (P = 0.01). Proteomic analysis identified three cytoskeletal elements, cofilin, profilin and gamma-actin, exclusively in the ADP-HSP preparation. Investigation of the mechanism of prevention of SIV replication suggests that antibodies to the cytoskeletal proteins may inhibit actin depolymerization and facilitate viral degradation by the innate antiviral APOBEC3G. As cytoskeletal proteins are critical in the formation of virological and immunological synapses, finding specific antibodies and anti-SIV/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) factors suggests a novel insight into HIV-1 immunopathogenesis."

We used an epitope discovery system, based on recombinant MHC class I molecules that cover the most frequent Caucasian alleles [human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0101, A*0201, A*0301, A*1101, A*2402, B*0702, B*0801 and B*1501], to identify MHC class I-binding peptides from overlapping 9-mer peptides representing the Mtb protein TB10.4. A total of 33 MHC class I-binding epitopes were identified, spread across the entire amino acid sequence, with some clustering at the N- and C-termini of the protein. Binding of individual peptides or closely related peptide species to different MHC class I alleles was frequently observed. For instance, the common motif of xIMYNYPAMx bound to six of eight alleles. Affinity (50% effective dose) and off-rate (half life) analysis of candidate Mtb peptides will help to define the conditions for CD8(+) T-cell interaction with their nominal MHC class I-peptide ligands. Subsequent construction of tetramers allowed us to confirm the recognition of some of the epitopes by CD8(+) T cells from patients with active pulmonary TB. HLA-B alleles served as the dominant MHC class I restricting molecules for anti-Mtb TB10.4-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses measured in CD8(+) T cells from patients with pulmonary TB."

Cross-strain comparison of three strains (highly resistant AD, moderately resistant PyriF and susceptible UD strains) revealed that resistant strains have relatively more Tuace copies than the UD strain and that the levels of transcript were directly proportional to copy numbers. AChEs from the AD and PyriF strains had similar V(max) values to those of AChE from the UD strain but increased K(m) and reduced k(cat) constants, suggesting that the mutated, resistant form of AChE may carry a fitness cost. Relative copy numbers of Tuace in field populations varied from 2.4 to 6.1, correlating well with their levels of resistance (r(2)= 0.895). These results are suggestive of the involvement of Tuace gene duplication in resistance. Thus, monocrotophos resistance in TSSMs appears to have evolved through a combination of mutation accumulation and extensive gene duplication."

This study investigated gene expression in groups of C. antarcticus that have distinct differences in their ability to survive low temperatures. A microarray containing c. 5400 C. antarcticus expressed sequence tags was used to investigate gene expression differences between groups of animals with different supercooling points (SCP), and to low temperatures close to their SCP. By demonstrating the involvement of moult-related genes in the differential survival of two groups of C. antarcticus with distinct SCP profiles, the results of this investigation add support to the suggestion that moulting plays a role in conferring cold tolerance in C. antarcticus."

Bioinformatic analyses of a male antennal expressed sequence tag library allowed the identification of 19 putative esterase genes expressed in the antennae of the moth Spodoptera littoralis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these genes belong to different insect esterase clades, defined by their putative cellular localization and substrate preferences. Interestingly, two of the 19 genes appeared to be antennal specific, suggesting a specific role in olfactory processing. This high esterase diversity suggested that the antennae are the location for intense esterase-based metabolism, against potentially a large range of exogenous and endogenous molecules."

Of the 10 pancreatic lipase family genes, six appear to encode active lipases and four encode inactive lipases, based on the presence/absence of essential catalytic residues. The four gastric lipase family genes appear to encode active proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of 54 lepidopteran pancreatic lipase proteins resolved the clade into five groups of midgut origin and a sixth of non-midgut lipases. The inactive proteins formed two separate groups with highly conserved mutations. The lepidopteran midgut lipases formed a ninth subfamily of pancreatic lipases. Eighteen insect and human gastric lipases were analysed phylogenetically with only very weak support for any groupings. Gene expression was measured in the larval midgut following feeding on five artificial diets and on apple leaves. The artificial diets contained different levels of triacylglycerol, linoleic acid and cholesterol. Significant changes in gene expression (more than 100-fold for active pancreatic lipases) were observed. All the inactive lipases were also highly expressed. The gastric lipase genes were expressed at lower levels and suppressed in larvae feeding on leaves. Together, protein motif analysis and the gene expression data suggest that, in phytophagous lepidopteran larvae, the pancreatic lipases may function in vivo as galactolipases and phospholipases whereas the gastric lipases may function as triacylglycerol hydrolases."

In experimental animals, BPA caused oocyte aneuploidy and reduced production of oestradiol. In a prospective cohort study, we investigated the association between urinary BPA concentrations and ovarian response among women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Fertility Center. The geometric mean of two specific-gravity (SG) adjusted urinary BPA concentrations collected during each IVF cycle was used as the cycle-specific BPA exposure level. BPA concentrations were measured using online solid phase extraction coupled to isotope dilution-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Peak serum oestradiol was measured using the Elecsys Estradiol II immunoassay kit. Multivariable mixed effect models and Poisson regression models adjusting for correlation between multiple IVF cycles in the same woman were used to evaluate the association between urinary BPA concentrations and ovarian response, adjusting for age, BMI and day 3 follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, a clinical measure of ovarian reserve. Urinary BPA concentrations were measured in 84 women (mean age 35.6 years) undergoing 112 IVF cycles; 23 women (27%) contributed more than one IVF cycle. BPA concentrations ranged from <0.4 to 25.5 microg/L (geometric mean 2.52 +/- SD 3.2); 15% of urine samples had concentrations <0.4 microg/L. Peak serum oestradiol levels correlated with the total number of oocytes retrieved per cycle (r = 0.65, p < 0.001). For each log unit increase in SG-BPA, there was an average decrease of 12% (95% CI: 4, 23%; p = 0.007) in the number of oocytes retrieved and an average decrease of 213 pg/ml (95% CI: -407, -20; p = 0.03) in peak oestradiol. BPA was detected in the urine of the majority of women undergoing IVF, and was inversely associated with number of oocytes retrieved and peak oestradiol levels."

The mouse model, which replicates many DES-related effects seen in humans, suggests that prenatal DES exposure causes alterations that may affect the next generation of offspring. We asked women participating in a large, multi-centre study of prenatal DES exposure to report birth defects occurring among 4029 sons and 3808 daughters (i.e., the third generation). A subcohort of 793 third generation daughters was also queried for birth defects. We used logistic regression models to generate odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals for the association between prenatal DES exposure in the mother and birth defects in the offspring. Based on the mothers' reports, overall birth defects were elevated in the sons (OR = 1.53; 95% CI = 1.04, 2.23) and in the daughters (OR = 2.35; 95% CI = 1.44, 3.82).

Our data suggest a possible association between the mother's prenatal DES exposure and birth defects in their offspring, particularly in daughters. We cannot, however, rule-out the possible influence of reporting bias. In particular, the exposed daughters' elevated risk of cardiac defects may be as a result of the underreporting of these conditions by unexposed mothers."

        "Abstract": "Since the 1970s, there has been a worldwide scientific discussion on the potential health consequences of human exposure to endocrine disrupters: many environmentally persistent compounds are oestrogen agonists and/or androgen antagonists. Thus, they can dysregulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis potentially affecting human puberty timing. Zearalenone (ZEA) is a non-steroidal mycotoxin produced by Fusarium species on several grains. Despite its low acute toxicity and carcinogenicity, ZEA exhibits oestrogenic and anabolic properties in several animal species. ZEA food contamination is caused either by direct contamination of grains, fruits and their based-products or by 'carry-over' of mycotoxins in animal tissues, milk and eggs after intake of contaminated feedstuff. In addition, zeranol (alpha-ZAL), a resorcyl lactone derived from ZEA, has been widely used in the USA as a growth promoter to improve fattening rates in cattle. From 1978 to 1984, a great epidemic of premature thelarche and precocious puberty occurred in Puerto Rico. To explain this condition, it was suggested that dairy and meat products could be contaminated with anabolic oestrogens such as ZEA or alpha-ZAL. Subsequently, worldwide other groups have also reported causative associations between oestrogenic mycotoxins and development of early thelarche and/or precocious puberty in exposed children. In addition to animal data, epidemiological studies strongly support the hypothesis that human pubertal development may be induced by foetal/early or prepubertal exposure to oestrogenic compounds. Indeed, ZEA and its metabolites are able to adopt molecular conformation, which sufficiently resembles 17beta-oestradiol to allow it to bind to oestrogen receptors (ERs) in target cells exerting oestrogenic (agonist) actions. In this view, oestrogenic mycotoxins are suspected as triggering factor for precocious pubertal development at least in prepubertal exposed girls."

        "Abstract": "We have shown previously that deficient androgen action within a masculinization programming window (MPW; e15.5-e18.5 in rats) is important in the origin of male reproductive disorders and in programming male reproductive organ size, but that androgen action postnatally may be important to achieve this size. To further investigate importance of the MPW, we used two rat models, in which foetal androgen production or action was impaired during the MPW by exposing in utero to either di(n-butyl) phthalate (DBP) or to flutamide. Reduced anogenital distance (AGD) was used as a monitor of androgen production/action during the MPW. Offspring were evaluated in early puberty (Pnd25) to establish if reproductive organ size was altered. The testes, penis, ventral prostate (VP) and seminal vesicles (SV) were weighed and penis length measured. Both DBP and flutamide exposure in the MPW significantly reduced penis, VP and SV size along with AGD at Pnd25; AGD and organ size were highly correlated. In DBP-, but not flutamide-, exposed animals, testis weight was also reduced and correlated with AGD. Intratesticular testosterone was also measured in control and DBP-exposed males during (e17.5) or after (e21.5) the MPW and related to AGD at e21.5. To evaluate the importance of postnatal androgen action in reproductive organ growth, the effect of combinations of prenatal and postnatal maternal treatments on AGD and penis size at Pnd25 was evaluated. In prenatally DBP-exposed animals, further postnatal exposure to either DBP or flutamide significantly reduced AGD and penis size in comparison with prenatal DBP exposure alone. In comparison, rats exposed postnatally to testosterone propionate after prenatal vehicle-exposure showed considerable increase in these parameters vs. controls. In conclusion, we show that the size of all male reproductive organs is programmed by androgen exposure in the MPW, but that growth towards this size is dependent on androgen action postnatally."

        "Abstract": "AeSCP-2, a sterol carrier protein, is involved in sterol trafficking in mosquitoes. The activity of the AeSCP-2 gene is important for mosquito development. An earlier study demonstrated that the transcription of this gene was upregulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) in cultured gut tissues. To investigate 20E-regulated transcription of the AeSCP-2 gene we truncated the upstream flanking region of AeSCP-2 gene and linked it to a reporter gene. The mosquito Aag-2 cell line was transfected with these promoter/reporter constructs and treated with 20E at various concentrations. Expression vectors of different transcription factors such as HR3 and beta FTZ-F1 were also co-transfected with the AeSCP-2 promoter/reporter constructs. The observed results demonstrated that varied combinations of transcription factors produce different promoter activities of the AeSCP-2 gene. This observation leads us to the conclusion that the partnership of transcription factors is crucial in regulating the transcriptional activity of the AeSCP-2 gene."

We demonstrate the temporal differential expression levels of the PBAN receptor (PBAN-R) gene, reaching peak levels at a critical period of 5 h post-eclosion. Previous studies implied a possible regulatory role for juvenile hormone (JH). We herein demonstrate that PBAN-R expression levels increase normally when females are decapitated or head-ligated, removing the source of JH, before peak transcript levels are reached. Similarly, sex pheromone production can be induced by PBAN in such decapitated females. These results indicate that up-regulation, at this critical time, is not dependent on JH originating from the head. Conversely, JH injected in vivo at this critical period significantly inhibits PBAN-R transcript levels."

Single cystoblasts differentiate to form germline cysts with 16 germline cells, all of which are connected by the fusome, a vesiculated structure critical for oocyte specification. We here show that histone H3K9 methyltransferase dg9a is associated with spectrosome/fusome formation in the germarium; dG9a(13414) mutant ovaries have disorganized spectrosome/fusome in about half the germaria, with reduced levels of hu-li tai shao and alpha-SPECTRIN proteins. We found that the amount of germline cells within cysts was reduced and that oocyte determination often failed in egg chambers of the dG9a(13414) mutant ovaries. These results suggest that a mutation in dG9a gene gives rise to anomalous spectrosome/fusome structures, which in turn lead to faulty germ-cell development in Drosophila ovaries."

To understand the induction mechanism, we created Drosophila S2 cell lines stably transformed with different luciferase reporter plasmids carrying upstream DNAs of Cyp6a8 allele of the resistant 91-R strain, and the 1.1-kb upstream DNAs of Cyp6g1 of the 91-R and the susceptible 91-C strains. Following 24 h treatment with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), caffeine or PB, luciferase activity of all cell lines was determined. Results showed that the 0.1-kb DNA of Cyp6a8 and the upstream DNAs of Cyp6g1 from both strains are not induced by these chemicals in S2 cells. However, the 0.2-, 0.5- and 0.8-kb DNAs of Cyp6a8 showed 13-24-, 4-5- and 2.2-2.7-fold induction with caffeine, PB and DDT, respectively. These DNAs also showed a 2-3-fold synergistic effect of caffeine and PB but not of caffeine and DDT. The results suggest that the cis-regulatory elements for all three chemicals are located within the -11/-199 DNA of Cyp6a8. Furthermore, caffeine and PB inductions appear to be mediated via different cis-elements, whereas caffeine and DDT induction may involve common regulatory elements. These stably transformed cell lines should help understand the mechanism of resistance-associated Cyp gene overexpression in Drosophila."

After liposuction of 250 mL of adipose tissue from the abdomen, we isolated ADSC from this tissue by using the Celution system. Subsequently, the isolated ADSC and a mixture of stem cells and adipose tissue were transurethrally injected into the rhabdosphincter and submucosal space of the urethra, respectively. Short-term outcomes during a 12-week follow-up were assessed by a 24-h pad test, a validated patient questionnaire, urethral pressure profile, transrectal ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging.Results:Urinary incontinence progressively improved after 2 weeks of injection up to 12 weeks in terms of decreased leakage volume in a 24-h pad test, decreased frequency and amount of incontinence, and improved quality of life as per the questionnaire. In urethral pressure profile, both maximum urethral closing pressure and functional profile length increased. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging showed sustained presence of the injected adipose tissue. Enhanced ultrasonography showed a progressive increase in the blood flow to the injected area. No significant adverse events were observed peri- and postoperatively.Conclusion:This preliminary study showed that periurethral injection of the autologous ADSC is a safe and feasible treatment modality for stress urinary incontinence."

        "Abstract": "Penile erection is a vascular event that requires an intact endothelium to occur. A dysfunctional endothelium is an early marker for the development of atherosclerotic changes and can also contribute to the occurrence of acute cardiovascular events. The pathogenesis of both endothelial and erectile dysfunction (ED) is intimately linked through decreased expression and activation of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase, and the subsequent blunted physiological actions of NO naturally occurring with aging. It is now well-understood that ED is a symptom of underlying disease rather than a disease itself; for this reason in the near future both general practitioners, internal medicine practitioners and many specialists will have to interplay with sexual medicine. Aging in the man is also associated with several changes in arterial structure and function, part of them related to the decline of circulating levels of steroids, that is, testosterone and estradiol. These changes may be responsible, in part, for the lack of efficacy of ED treatments. The recent discovery that chronic administration of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors may improve erectile and endothelial responsiveness of men previously non-responsive to on-demand regimes, and the knowledge that testosterone is one of the main modulators of the expression of penile phosphodiesterase type 5 isoenzyme, opens a new scenario in the treatment of men with ED and co-morbidities. The aim of this review is to discuss the pathophysiology of endothelial dysfunction and its relationship with ED in the aging male, and to suggest possible strategies to improve arterial function with regard to sexual dysfunctions."

        "Abstract": "The semicircular canals of the inner ear sense angular accelerations and decelerations of the head and enable co-ordination of posture and body movement, as well as visual stability. Differences of agility and spatial sensitivity among species have been linked to interspecific differences in the relative size of the canals, particularly the radius of curvature (R) and the ratio of the canal plane area to streamline length (P/L). Here we investigate the scaling relationships of these two size variables and also out-of-plane torsion in the three semicircular canals (anterior, posterior and lateral), in order to assess which is more closely correlated with body size and locomotor agility. Measurements were computed from 3D landmarks taken from magnetic resonance images of a diverse sample of placental mammals encompassing 16 eutherian orders. Body masses were collected from the literature and an agility score was assigned to each species. The R and P/L of all three semicircular canals were found to have highly significant positive correlations with each other and no statistical difference was found between the slope of 2P/L against R and 1. This indicated that, contrary to initial hypotheses, there is little difference between 2P/L and R as measures of semicircular canal size. A measure of the in-plane circularity of the canal was obtained by dividing 2P/L by R and out-of-plane torsion was measured as angular deviation from a plane of best fit. It was predicted that deviations from in-plane and out-of-plane circularity would increase at small body size due to the constraints of fitting a proportionately larger canal into a smaller petrous bone. However, neither measurement was found to have a significant correlation with body mass, indicating that deviations from circularity (both in-plane and out-of-plane) are not sufficient to alter P/L to an extent that would impact the sensitivity of the canals. 2P/L and R were both shown to be significantly correlated with locomotor agility. The posterior canal was the least correlated with agility, suggesting that it may be generally less closely aligned to the direction of movement than the anterior canal. Of the three canals, the lateral canal was the most highly correlated with agility. In particular, it could be used to distinguish between species that move in a largely 2D environment and those that locomote in 3D space (aerial, arboreal and aquatic species). This complements previous work suggesting that the lateral canal primarily commands navigation, whereas the vertical canals control reflex adjustments. It was also found that 2P/L is substantially better correlated with agility than is R in the lateral canal. This result is intriguing given the above finding that there is no statistical difference between 2P/L and R, and requires further investigation."

        "Abstract": "The art of wax modelling has an ancient origin but rose to prominence in 14th century Italy with the cult of votive artefacts. With the advent of Neoclassicism this art, now deemed repulsive, continued to survive in a scientific environment, where it flourished in the study of normal and pathological anatomy, obstetrics, zoology and botany. The achievement of having originated the creation of anatomical models in coloured wax must be ascribed to a joint effort undertaken by the Sicilian wax modeller Gaetano Giulio Zumbo and the French surgeon Guillaume Desnoues in the late 17th century. Interest in anatomical wax models spread throughout Europe during the 18th century, first in Bologna with Ercole Lelli, Giovanni Manzolini and Anna Morandi, and then in Florence with Felice Fontana and Clemente Susini. In England, the art of anatomical ceroplastics was brought to London from Florence by the sculptor Joseph Towne. Throughout the centuries many anatomical artists preferred this material due to the remarkable mimetic likeness obtained, far surpassing any other material. Independent of the material used, whether wood, wax or clay, anatomical models were always considered merely craft works confined to hospitals or faculties of medicine and have survived to this day only because of their scientific interest. Italian and English waxes are stylistically different but the remarkable results obtained by Susini and Towne, and the fact that some contemporary artists are again representing anatomical wax bodies in their works, makes the border that formerly separated art and craft indistinguishable."

Interpretation of scientific imagery, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is restricted to the eye of the trained medical practitioner in a clinical or scientific context. In the research work described here, MRI data are visualized and interpreted by a 3-D computer artist using the tools of the digital animator to navigate image complexity and widen interaction. In this process, the artefact moves across disciplines; it is no longer tethered to its diagnostic origins. It becomes an object that has visual attributes such as light, texture and composition, and a visual aesthetic of its own. The introduction of these visual attributes provides a platform for improved accessibility by a lay audience. The paper argues that this more artisan approach to clinical data visualization has a potential real-world application as a communicative tool for clinicians and patients during consultation."

        "Abstract": "1. Changes in the density of an organism near a boundary elements (edge effects) are often thought to be generated by changes in movement behaviour, but in most cases the mechanism underlying these effects is unknown. 2. We quantified the movement behaviour of a minute parasitic wasp, Anagrus columbi, in relation to edges in its habitat. This wasp attacks eggs of the planthopper Prokelisia crocea, which inhabits a wet prairie ecosystem composed of patches of its host plant prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata) interspersed within a matrix of mudflat, smooth brome (Bromus inermis) and native grasses. Two edge types are common in this system, cordgrass-mudflat and cordgrass-brome. 3. We conducted mark-recapture experiments in which wasps were released at the cordgrass-matrix edge and 50 cm within cordgrass or matrix, for both edge types. The marked wasps were recaptured using a grid of sticky traps. We fitted an advection-diffusion model to these data, yielding estimates of the diffusion rate and advection coefficient for cordgrass and matrix, for each release position and edge type. 4. The spatial distribution of wasps was well-described by the advection-diffusion model. The pattern suggests that marked wasps strongly biased their movements towards the edge when released in matrix, and to a lesser extent when released in cordgrass, while edge releases showed little bias. The advection coefficients were similar for the two edge types, as were the diffusion rates for the three substrates (cordgrass, brome, mudflat). The diffusive and advective components of movement were of comparable magnitude for matrix and cordgrass releases, suggesting equal amounts of directed and random movement. 5. Our results suggest the wasps are attracted to cordgrass patches across short distances, and that bias in their movements may concentrate them at the patch edge. Their edge behaviour is qualitatively different from that of the host insect. 6. The methodology described here could be readily adapted to other systems, where direct observations of movement are difficult but mark-recapture studies are feasible."

Here data from populations of native red deer Cervus elaphus and invasive sika deer Cervus nippon in Scotland is used to assess the extent to which hybridisation between them is causing phenotypic change. This is done by regression of phenotypic traits against genetic hybrid scores. 3. Hybridisation is causing increases in the body weight of sika-like deer and decreases in the body weight of red-like females. Hybridisation is causing increases in jaw length and increases in incisor arcade breadth in sika-like females. Hybridisation is also causing decreases in incisor arcade breadth in red-like females. 4. There is currently no evidence that hybridisation is causing changes in the kidney fat weight or pregnancy rates of either population. 5. Increased phenotypic similarity between the two species is likely to lead to further hybridisation. The ecological consequences of this are difficult to predict."

Cardiac Computed Tomographic Angiography helps locate these wires precisely, enabling detailed surgical planning. Sternal wire migration is an infrequent complication following median sternotomy. It is usually encountered among patients with sternal dehiscence. Understanding the location and spatial relationships of structures to the wire can be challenging. (64 slice) with high spatial and temporal resolution affords the possibility of enhancing presurgical planning."

        "Abstract": "We report a unique case of the CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). A 44-year-old Japanese male presented with lymphadenopathy followed by skin involvement. Initially, a swollen cervical lymph node was recognized in 1989 and relapsed in 1991, which was histologically diagnosed as Hodgkin disease of nodular sclerotic type. In 1996, he presented ulcerative cutaneous nodules and swollen lymph nodes in his left inguinal region, which was then diagnosed with CD30+ ALCL. Both the lymphadenopathy and the skin lesion had been completely remitted by combining chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. Thereafter, he had relapsing and remitting episodes of multiple papules and nodules on his face, trunk and extremities for 10 years. Repeated histopathological examination revealed similar tumor cell proliferation in the papules/nodules of the skin. Essentially similar immunohistochemical features, including CD30 and granzyme B expression, but not anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), strongly suggested that all these tumors were sequential expression of one disease continued for 19 years. This case was finally diagnosed as CD30+ ALCL with unique skin involvement mimicking lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP)."

        "Abstract": "Stem cell biology is currently making its impact on medicine, which will probably increase over the next decades. It not only influences our therapeutic thinking caused by the enormous plasticity of stem cells but also affects diagnostic and conceptual aspects of dermatopathology. Although our knowledge of the keratinocytic stem cells located within the follicular bulge has exploded exponentially since their discovery in 1990, the concept of cutaneous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is new. Described initially in 2001 in mice, MSCs later were also found in the human dermis. The connective tissue sheath and the papilla of the hair follicle probably represent the anatomical niche for cutaneous MSCs. In line with the cancer stem cell hypothesis, mutations of these cells may be the underlying basis of mesenchymal skin neoplasms, such as dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Furthermore, research on cutaneous MSCs may impact our thinking on the interaction of the epithelial component of skin neoplasms with their surrounding stroma. We are only in the early stages to recognize the importance of the potential contributions of cutaneous MSC research to dermatopathology, but it is not inconceivable to assume that they could be tremendous, paralleling the early discovery of the follicular bulge as a stem cell niche."

For comparison, histological findings in 45 patients (18 males, 27 females; mean, 55.64 years) with lichen simplex (LS) were studied. PN and LS, both of them scratch-induced, had 50 of 58 (86.2%) histological features in common.Conclusions:PN revealed a characteristic histological pattern. Absence of pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia or nerve fiber thickening, however, does not rule out the histological diagnosis of PN. A correlation of clinical and histological findings is necessary to reliably distinguish between PN and LS."

Conventional systemic treatment is often unsatisfactory and limited by long-term toxicity. The use of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists has been reported previously in single cases, but lacking long-term follow-up or comparison between different biological agents.Objectives:To assess the long-term efficacy and safety of TNF-alpha antagonist, infliximab and etanercept, either in monotherapy or in combination therapy of severe, refractory adult-onset PRP.Methods:Seven patients of adult-onset PRP, six newly diagnosed type-I and 1 type-II, which were resistant or ineligible to conventional systemic treatment, received a single course of infliximab or etanercept therapy, alone or in combination with low-dose acitretin (>0.25 mg/kg/daily). After complete remission and treatment discontinuation, a follow-up period of 12 months was evaluated for relapses.Results:Six patients obtained complete remission after a single course of anti-TNF-alpha therapy: mean therapy duration was 19.3 weeks (range 6-48 weeks). All patients obtained significant clearing (>75% of body surface area) of skin lesions at week 12. Two patients with marked keratoderma developed localized disease recurrence during treatment. During follow-up, only a single patient, affected by type II PRP, had disease relapse.Conclusions:Both TNF-alpha antagonists proved successful for the treatment of refractory, adult-onset PRP, yielding complete and persistent clinical responses in type-I PRP. Infliximab was associated with a more rapid onset of action, while treatment duration was comparable with etanercept. PRP type II warranted long-term therapy and showed relapse after drug discontinuation."

        "Abstract": "Mating behaviour affects reproductive isolation and phenotypic differentiation. In Lake Tanganyika, the cichlid fish Tropheus moorii diversified into numerous, currently allopatric colour variants. Allopatric isolation is periodically interrupted by dispersal and secondary contact during lake level fluctuations, making long-term differentiation partly dependent on assortative mating. Laboratory experiments with two moderately distinct morphs revealed assortative female preferences in one (Nakaku), but random mate choice in the other morph (Mbita). No discrimination was apparent between two subtly differentiated morphs (Chimba and Moliro). Tested against each other in a previous study, the highly distinct Moliro and Nakaku exhibited strong assortative preferences. The correlation between colour pattern similarity and mate discrimination suggests that allopatry and philopatric behaviour are less crucial for the maintenance of differentiation between highly distinct morphs than for more similar morphs. Interestingly, the asymmetric isolation in one pair of morphs is congruent with a pattern of unidirectional mitochondrial introgression between populations."

It has been hypothesized that different types of ORs are required in terrestrial and marine environments. Here we show that viviparous sea snakes, which do not rely on a terrestrial environment, have significantly lost ORs compared with their terrestrial relatives, supporting the hypothesis. On the other hand, oviparous sea snakes, which rely on a terrestrial environment for laying eggs, still maintain their ORs, reflecting the importance of the terrestrial environment for them. Furthermore, we found one Colubroidea snake (including sea snakes and their terrestrial relatives)-specific OR subfamily which had diverged widely during snake evolution after the blind snake-Colubroidea snake split. Interestingly, no pseudogenes are included in this subfamily in sea snakes, and this subfamily seems to have been expanding rapidly even in an underwater environment. These findings suggest that the Colubroidea-specific ORs detect nonvolatile odorants."

We provide the first estimates of lifetime breeding success (LBS) and lambda(ind) (the population growth rate of an individual) of European badgers Meles meles, by genotyping 915 individuals, sampled over 18 years, for 22 microsatellites. Males are slightly larger than females, and the opportunity for selection was slightly greater for males, as predicted. lambda(ind) and LBS both performed well in predicting the number of grand-offspring, and both detected selection for a late omega, until the age of eight. Differential selection (S'(alpha)) for an early alpha, however, was only detected using LBS, not with lambda(ind). In declining populations (lambda(ind) < 1) selection favours reproduction later in life, whereas early reproduction is selected in increasing populations (lambda(ind) > 1). As 41% of badgers were assigned only one offspring (lambda(ind) < 1), whereas 40% were assigned more than two (lambda(ind) > 1), this cancelled out S'(alpha) measured by lambda(ind)."

Here, I investigate the consequences of such interactions for response in fitness due to natural selection. I provide quantitative genetic expressions for heritable variance and response in fitness due to natural selection when conspecifics interact. Results show that interactions among conspecifics generate extra heritable variance in fitness, and that interacting with kin is the key to evolutionary success because it translates the extra heritable variance into response in fitness. This work also unifies Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection (FTNS) and Hamilton's inclusive fitness (IF). The FTNS implies that natural selection maximizes fitness, whereas Hamilton proposed maximization of IF. This work shows that the FTNS describes the increase in IF, rather than direct fitness, at a rate equal to the additive genetic variance in fitness. Thus, Hamilton's IF and Fisher's FTNS both describe the maximization of IF."

The main objective of this study was to review the spatial regression techniques employed to test the association between morphological and environmental variables. In addition, we show empirically how spatial regression techniques can be used to test the association of cranial form variation among worldwide human populations with a set of ecological variables, taking into account the spatial autocorrelation in data. We suggest that spatial autocorrelation must be studied to explore the spatial structure underlying morphological variation and incorporated in regression models to provide more accurate statistical estimates of the relationships between morphological and ecological variables. Finally, we discuss the statistical properties of these techniques and the underlying reasons for using the spatial approach in population studies."

We collected Ostrinia larvae on maize (70 populations, 8425 individuals) and mugwort (10 populations, 1184 individuals) and recorded parasitism using both traditional (counting emerging parasitoids) and molecular methods (detection by specific polymerase chain reaction). The main parasitoid was Macrocentrus cingulum (Braconidae). On mugwort, parasitism was twice that on maize, and parasitoid-related mortality was 8 times higher. This suggests that maize affords substantial EFS to Ostrinia feeding on it. The lower Mortality:Infestation ratio in maize suggests that O. nubilalis' immune response might be stronger than that of O. scapulalis. If so, adapting to maize and diverging from O. scapulalis would decrease the impact of parasitism on O. nubilalis at both ecological and evolutionary levels."

Nevertheless, despite its obvious biogeographic appeal, the tempo of Canid evolution in South America has never been studied thoroughly. This issue can be suitably tackled with the inference of a molecular timescale. In this study, using a relaxed molecular clock method, we estimated that the most recent common ancestor of South American canids lived around 4 Ma, whereas all other splits within the clade occurred after the rise of the Panamanian land bridge. We suggest that the early diversification of the ancestors of the two main lineages of South American canids may have occurred in North America, before the Great American Interchange. Moreover, a concatenated morphological and molecular analysis put some extinct canid species well within the South American radiation, and shows that the dental adaptations to hypercarnivory evolved only once in the South American clade."

Here, for the first time we apply a perceptual model of colour discrimination to study behavioural responses to natural variation in parasite egg appearance in chaffinches Fringilla coelebs. Discrimination of parasite eggs gradually increased with increasing differences in chromatic contrasts as perceived by birds between parasite and host eggs. These results confirm that colour differences of the eggs as perceived by birds are important integral parts of a matching signal used by chaffinch hosts."

However, if the ecological niche evolves as part of the speciation process, the ecological pattern could be useful for recognizing cryptic species. In a broad sense systematists agree that the niche characters could be used for species differentiation. However, to date such characters have been ignored. We used the genetic algorithm for rule-set production for modelling the ecological niche as a means of inferring ecological divergence in allopatric populations of muroid rodents for which taxonomic identity is uncertain. Our results show that niche differentiation is significant in most of the identified phylogroups. The differentiation is likely associated with natural evolutionary units, which can be identified by applying species concepts based on phylogenetic and ecological patterns (e.g. phylogenetic, cohesive, evolutionary). Even so, the role of the niche partition within phylogenetic reconstruction may be a limited one."

Dispersal across such environments is predicted to have a major impact on local coevolutionary dynamics. Here, we address how co-dispersal of coevolving populations of host and parasite across an environmental productivity gradient affected coevolution in experimental populations of bacteria and their parasitic viruses (phages). The rate of coevolution between bacteria and phages was greater in high-productivity environments. High-productivity immigrants ( approximately 2% of the recipient population) caused coevolutionary dynamics (rates of coevolution and degree of generalist evolution) in low-productivity environments to be largely indistinguishable from high-productivity environments, whereas immigration from low-productivity environments ( approximately 0.5% of the population) had no discernable impact. These results could not be explained by demography alone, but rather high-productivity immigrants had a selective advantage in low-productivity environments, but not vice versa. Coevolutionary interactions in high-productivity environments are therefore likely to have a disproportionate impact on coevolution across the landscape as a whole."

This error led Wynne-Edwards to explain sustainable exploitation in animals by selection against overexploiting groups. Williams riposted that selection among groups rarely overrides within-group selection. Hamilton showed that altruism can evolve through kin selection. How strongly does group selection influence evolution? Following Price, Hamilton showed how levels of selection interact: group selection prevails if Hamilton's rule applies. Several showed that group selection drove some major evolutionary transitions. Following Hamilton's lead, Queller extended Hamilton's rule, replacing genealogical relatedness by the regression on an actor's genotypic altruism of interacting neighbours' phenotypic altruism. Price's theorem shows the generality of Hamilton's rule. All instances of group selection can be viewed as increasing inclusive fitness of autosomal genomes. Nonetheless, to grasp fully how cooperation and altruism evolve, most biologists need more concrete concepts like kin selection, group selection and selection among individuals for their common good."

        "Abstract": "The local density of individuals is seldom uniform in space and time within natural populations. Yet, formal approaches to the process of isolation by distance in continuous populations have encountered analytical difficulties in describing genetic structuring with demographic heterogeneities, usually disregarding local correlations in the movement and reproduction of genes. We formulate exact recursions for probabilities of identity in continuous populations, from which we deduce definitions of effective dispersal () and effective density (D(e)) that generalize results relating spatial genetic structure, dispersal and density in lattice models. The latter claim is checked in simulations where estimates of effective parameters obtained from demographic information are compared with estimates derived from spatial genetic patterns in a plant population evolving in a heterogeneous and dynamic habitat. The simulations further suggest that increasing spatio-temporal correlations in local density reduce and generally decrease the product , with dispersal kurtosis influencing their sensitivity to density fluctuations. As in the lattice model, the expected relationship between the product and the genetic structure statistic a(r) holds under fluctuating density, irrespective of dispersal kurtosis. The product D sigma(2) between observed census density and the observed dispersal rate over one generation will generally be an upwardly biased (up to 400% in simulations) estimator of in populations distributed in spatially aggregated habitats."

        "Abstract": "Models reveal that sexually antagonistic co-evolution exaggerates female resistance and male persistence traits. Here we adapt an established model by including directional sexual selection acting against persistence. We find similar equilibria to previous models showing that sexually antagonistic co-evolution can be limited by counteracting sexual, as well as, natural selection. We tested the model using empirical data for the seaweed fly, Coelopa ursina, in which body size acts as a persistence and a resistance trait. Our model can generate continuous co-evolutionary cycles and stable equilibria, however, all simulations using empirically derived parameter estimates reach stable equilibria. Thus, stable equilibria might be more common in nature than continuous co-evolutionary cycles, suggesting that sexual conflict is unlikely to promote speciation. The model predicts male biased sexual size dimorphism for C. ursina, comparable with empirically observed values. Male persistence is shown to be more sensitive than female resistance to changes in model parameters."

Inter- and intra-examiner comparisons were conducted and a computer program (Implant Recognition System) was evaluated to see whether it improved the accuracy of implant recognition. The study found that dental implants could be radiographically differentiated by company type. The Implant Recognition System in its current form was of little benefit for radiographic assessment of dental implants for forensic odontologists. Prior knowledge of implant types, with a McNemar's statistical value of 92.9, proved to be most significant in identification."

The hospital workers found the woman dead with her head stuck to the ironing machine. After the death scene investigation and autopsy were completed, it was determined that the death occurred as a result of accidental ligature strangulation. Accidental ligature strangulation in which an article of clothing is caught in such an electrical machine and strangles the wearer is very rare. This case highlights the fact that these kinds of machines can be hazardous to work around and that increased safety measures should be taken to insure worker safety; additionally, the people who use these machines should be educated on the potential hazards."

The temporal fluorescence response profile of the microsphere array generated a reproducible pattern unique to each analyte that could be used to classify subsequent sensor responses. This system, together with a support vector machine pattern recognition algorithm, was used to address several different IL and ILR classification scenarios. High classification accuracy (98%) was maintained over more than 200 vapor responses and the array was able to identify ILs when presented to the pattern classification algorithm within a dataset containing 11 other volatile compounds. Both burned and unburned IL treated samples were classified correctly greater than 97% of the time. These results indicate that microsphere vapor sensing arrays may be useful for the rapid identification of ILs and ILRs."

This paper explores the quantitative effects of inclusion or exclusion of the eminences on the maximum length measure across ancestral population, age and sex in five human adult populations of American Whites and Blacks, two Native American samples, and East Asians. A Tukey's post hoc comparison was employed to determine the overall effect of inclusion the intercondylar eminences has on metric assessment of the tibia. Results show no significant effect on comparative analysis of the tibia by age or sex. However, the difference between sample means by ancestry is significant (p < 0.0001). These results pose interesting questions concerning the morphological differences between ancestral groups. This investigation prompts further study of population variation of the human knee."

Trace acidic and neutral heroin impurities were isolated from basic fractions using liquid-liquid extraction. Extracted impurities were treated with N-Methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide followed by PTV-GC-MS analyses. Semiquantitative data were obtained using full scan mass spectrometry utilizing unique ions or ion combinations for 36 trace impurities found in crude and/or highly refined heroin samples. Minimum detection limits for acidic and neutral impurities were estimated to be at the 10(-7) level relative to total morphine. Over 500 authentic heroin samples from South America, Mexico, Southwest Asia, and Southeast Asia were analyzed.

Such removal is also necessary prior to deposition of test fingerprints. The effectiveness of four regimes in removing fingerprint deposits from brass is considered. Sustained wiping of the deposit with a tissue at applied pressures of up to c. 1430 Pa or rubbing while the brass was immersed in acetone both failed to remove completely all traces of fingerprint deposits. Heating the brass to 600 degrees C was an effective remover; however, this also oxidized the surface of the metal except where inhibited by fingerprint deposits. The most effective regime, and the only one of the four that removed all traces of deposit without affecting the properties of the metal surface, was immersion in warm soapy water while rubbing with a tissue. We propose this as the preferred method for fingerprint removal."

It was concluded that printing defects are random occurrences and that morphological differences can be used to identify variations within the same production batch. The second part incorporated a blind study to assess the error rate of associating randomly selected envelopes from different retail locations to a known source. The examination was based on the comparison of printing defects in the security patterns found in some envelopes. The results demonstrated that it is possible to associate envelopes to a common origin with a 0% error rate."

During the studied time period, there were 10 homicide-suicide cases identified with 10 perpetrators killing 12 victims. Nine of the perpetrators were men and eight of the victims were women. The precipitating motive was an impending divorce in four of the cases. Two perpetrators were described as severely depressed, one had a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, and one was a pedophile who had reactive depression. Firearms were used in eight of the homicide cases and seven of the suicides.

Third molar developmental stages were evaluated according to the stages proposed by Nolla. The frequencies of different stages of mineralization and the mean value of the mineralization of the mandibular third molars with regard to age, gender, and size of the mandible were determined and the coefficient of correlation determined between the age of the subject and the stage of development of the mandibular molars. Statistically significant correlation was determined between mineralization of the mandibular third molar and chronological age of the subjects (boys, mandibular left third molar r = 0.779, right third molar r = 0.793; girls, mandibular left third molar r = 0.746, right third molar r = 0.725).

We completed this study with multiple regression equations of total palatine suture scores. We compared our results with those obtained using the Mann method on the one hand and classically segmented and scored ectocranial suture age determination methods on the other. Palatine sutures generally do not estimate age at death any better than cranial vault sutures. Despite the partly subjective aspect of suture study, palatine suture observation contributes additional information to age-range estimation, especially in old and very old subjects where other methods lose their effectiveness."

Rate of force application and bite pressure were controlled. Metric/angular measurement and hollow volume overlays were employed. Distortion produced by each dentition was calculated and assessed. Results showed that as teeth impressed loose tissue, mesial/distal distance increased, angles of rotation flattened, and inter-canine distance lengthened. An opposite effect was seen in tight tissue. When the surface area of the dentition was reduced, a mixture of these effects was observed. Conclusions indicated that stiffness of the tissue was the most important variable in bitemark distortion."

Pearson product moment correlation coefficients and principal components analysis were used to evaluate differences in discrimination among the diesel samples afforded by each temperature program, based on the total ion chromatogram (TIC) and selected extracted ion profiles (EIPs). Association of diesel replicates and discrimination among samples based on the TIC and aromatic EIP were similar for all temperature programs based on scores plots. The alkane EIP was not useful in discriminating samples regardless of temperature program, because of similar alkane content of the diesel samples. The association and discrimination of diesel samples was largely unaffected by temperature programs that incorporated one- or two-step temperature ramps."

DNA recovery using 20% Chelex extraction and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was also explored. Gamma irradiation proved effective as a bacterial decontaminant with D-values ranging from 458 to 500 Gy for nonporous items and 797-808 Gy for porous ones.

We synthesized derivatives of ninhydrin and 1,2-indanedione containing loosely bound thiol groups. In particular: thiohemiketals (THK) of ninhydrin, and thioketals of 1,2-indanedione were prepared and tested as potential fingerprint reagents. By reacting ninhydrin with various thiols we were able to produce a series of novel THK, bearing the SR group always at C2. Ninhydrin THK reacted with amino acids to produce the expected Ruhemann's purple, and they also developed latent fingermarks on paper in a similar manner to ninhydrin. Ketals and thioketals derived from 1,2-indanedione reacted neither with amino acids nor with latent fingermarks. In the second part of the research, the thiols which are formed on the ridges as byproducts of the reaction with amino acids will be tested for their potential as stabilizers for gold NP that will become covalently bound to the fingerprint ridges."

        "Abstract": "A previous study published in 2000 on a small group of children concluded that the medical examination in cases of sexual child abuse seldom provided legal proof of sexual abuse [J Forensic Sci 45(2000):115-7]. The present consecutive study included children referred to the police for a forensic medical examination. A colposcope was used to evaluate the anogenital findings which were classified as normal, nonspecific, and abnormal. Four hundred and eighty-two children were included. Abnormal anogenital findings were found in 38% of the girls and 20% of the boys, but there was no relation between abnormal anogenital findings and the two legal outcomes: \"appearing in court\" and \"being convicted.\" However, the age of the child turned out to be a more important factor in relation to legal outcome than the physical findings. The results of this study suggest that the child's statement and not the physical findings were important for legal outcome."

Burning, fragmentation, species commingling, and examination by multiple experts required anthropological preparation and analysis combined with radiographic adaptations to image and match trabecular patterns in unusually small, burned specimens. A missing person was last seen in the company of a reclusive female on a remote rural property. A warranted search found several burn sites containing human and animal bones. Fragment preparation, analysis, and development of a biological profile by anthropologists enabled examination by the odontologist, molecular biologist, and radiologist, and justified use of antemortem radiographs from one potential victim. Visual and radiological comparison resulted in a positive (later confirmed) identification of the victim by radiological matches of three carpal phalanges. Although some dimensional changes are expected with burning, morphological details were preserved, aided by selection of relatively intact, small bones for comparison."

        "Abstract": "Rapid and informative ABO genotyping has become increasingly popular in forensic use. We developed a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach to genotype ABO major groups and subgroups. Seven differently fluorophor-labeled displacing probes for O(1)(261delG), A(261G), A(796C/803C), B(796A/803C), O(2) (802G>A), A(2) (1059delC), and A(2) (1009A>G) were combined in one or two PCRs to determine either ABO major groups or subgroups. The method correctly detected 13 reference DNA samples. A blind test of 237 samples resulted in complete agreement with their phenotypes, and 110 of these 237 samples as well as with PCR-SSP method. The whole analysis could be finished in less than 100 min at substantially low material cost and the template DNA ranging from 0.16 to 500 ng per reaction could be quantitatively detected. Despite the limited informativeness of ABO genotyping, the developed methods could find application in rapid and inexpensive screening of forensic settings."

In the majority (91/100), the preautopsy and postautopsy proximate causes of death were in agreement. In 9%, the autopsy provided information that resulted in a proximate cause of death different than anticipated. In four instances, the manner of death also was incorrect and was determined to be an accident rather than the originally presumed natural. No homicide or suicide would have been misclassified. In another nine instances, where the premortem and postmortem proximate causes of death were in agreement, the autopsy provided a specific mechanism of death. With a quality initial medicolegal death investigation, a subset of sudden deaths in adults may be reliably certified without an autopsy."

We retrospectively reviewed 500 consecutive CT KUB studies requested for suspected renal colic carried out at a single institution between December 2006 and July 2007. Follow-up radiology reports and discharge summaries on the hospital clinical Intranet were also reviewed. Studies were analysed for characteristics including patient demographics, referring clinical team, time of referral, final diagnosis and requirement for further imaging. The majority of requests were from Emergency (ED) or Urology Departments (49%, 245 out of 500, and 37%, 186 out of 500, respectively). The positive rate for urolithiasis was 67% (337 out of 500), the negative rate was 25% (123 out of 500), and 8% (40 out of 500) of patients had alternative significant findings. Female patients were more likely to have a negative study than male patients (35 versus 20%, P < 0.0001) and more likely to have alternative significant pathology (12 versus 6%, P < 0.0001). Patients referred by specialities other than Urology and ED were more likely to be female and have a negative or alternative finding (P < 0.0001). CT KUB is a widely used first method of investigation for patients with suspected renal colic with a high positive predictive value allowing rapid diagnosis and intervention. However, given the high rate of negative or alternative findings on CT KUB in young women, especially those referred by specialities other than ED or Urology, ultrasound should be considered as an alternative imaging method to minimise unnecessary radiation exposure."

To our knowledge, there is no large case series in Asian countries in which a clinico-radiological descriptive analysis of these tumours has been carried out. In this retrospective study, we analysed our experience of 70 patients with histopathologically proven GISTs, who were presurgically investigated by using CT, and describe the demography, anatomical distribution, imaging features and clinical course of the GIST. We found an unusually large predominance of males in our study, stomach and small bowel appeared to have been involved similarly and small bowel tumours had a higher rate of metastases. We also highlight some unusual CT features of these tumours that we encountered during the study, such as the presence of metastatic lymphadenopathy and satellite nodules, relapse in appendices epiploicae of the bowel, metachronous liposarcoma, adrenal and lung metastases, multiplicity of lesions and aneurysmal dilatation of the bowel. Two of our patients also had multiple neurofibromas, whose association with GIST has been seen in earlier reports. To the best of our knowledge, this article presents one of the largest series of articles on GISTs, to date, in Asian countries. We conclude with a differential diagnosis of GIST, with salient features distinguishing each entity."

The purpose of this exploratory study was to survey reader practice in reporting screening mammograms in Australia to identify aspects of practice that warrant further investigation. Mammography reporting practice and influences on concentration and attention were investigated by using an original questionnaire distributed to screen readers in Australia. A response rate of 71% (83 out of 117) was achieved. Demographic data indicated that the majority of readers were over 46 years of age (73%), have been reporting on screening mammograms for over 10 years (61%), take less than 1 min to report upon a screening mammogram examination (66%), report up to 200 examinations in a single session (83%) and take up to 2 h to report one session (61%). A majority report on more than 5000 examinations annually (66%); 93% of participants regard their search strategy as systematic, 87% agreed that their concentration can vary throughout a session, 64% agreed that the relatively low number of positives can lead to lapses in concentration and attention and almost all (94%) participants agreed that methods to maximise concentration should be explored. Participants identified a range of influences on concentration within their working environment including volume of images reported in one session, image types and aspects of the physical environment. This study has provided important evidence of the need to investigate adverse influences on concentration during mammography screen reporting."

        "Abstract": "The endovascular treatment of carotid atherosclerosis with carotid artery stenting (CAS) remains controversial. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) remains the benchmark in terms of procedural mortality and morbidity. Consensus Australasian guidelines for the safe performance of CAS were developed using the modified Delphi consensus method of iterative consultation. Selection of patients suitable for CAS needs careful consideration of clinical and patho-anatomical criteria. Randomised controlled trials and pooled analyses have demonstrated that CAS is more hazardous than CEA. The CGSC therefore recommends that CAS should not be performed in the majority of patients requiring carotid revascularisation. There is currently no evidence to support CAS as a treatment for asymptomatic carotid stenosis. The use of distal protection devices during CAS remains controversial with increased risk of clinically silent stroke. The knowledge requirements for the safe performance of CAS include an understanding of the evidence base from randomised controlled trials, carotid and aortic arch anatomy and pathology, and recognition and management of periprocedural complications. It is critical that all patients being considered for a carotid intervention have adequate pre-procedural neuroimaging and peri-procedural, independent, neurological assessment. Maintenance of proficiency in CAS requires active involvement in surgical/endovascular audit and continuing medical education programmes. These standards should apply in the public and private health-care settings. These guidelines represent the consensus of an intercollegiate committee in order to direct appropriate patient selection to perform CAS. Advances in endovascular technologies and the results of randomised controlled trials will guide future revisions of this document."

Our review provided extended follow-up results in nine cases, presents a technical discussion on measures taken to minimise foetal radiation exposure and provides a comprehensive summary of the literature. Nine patients who received radiotherapy while pregnant are described. The clinical presentation and outcomes of these and 100 additional cases identified on a systematic literature review are presented. Comparisons of scattered radiation doses from three linear accelerators are presented. The average maternal follow-up in our series was 8.9 years with one patient having a recurrence of their astrocytoma. In terms of foetal outcome, there were one death in utero, one elective termination of pregnancy and one on which no data were available. Six children, on whom long-term follow-up (average 10.3 years) was obtainable, were in good health. Overall, there had been 109 cases of radiotherapy in pregnancy that met our search criteria with 13 adverse outcomes and a median follow-up of 37 months. Comparisons of three linear accelerators demonstrated significant differences in the amount of scattered radiation to the abdominal surface. In summary radiotherapy during pregnancy can be associated with a significant number of adverse outcomes. While it may be difficult for a patient not to attribute these effects to radiotherapy, it is also difficult to define the mechanisms by which radiotherapy would have caused them, if that were the case."

The investigators were seeking an information base to facilitate design of an appropriate controlled trial of the use of deodorants during radiotherapy. The first component consisted of a survey of women after adjuvant breast radiotherapy seeking information about routine deodorant use and potential concern if deodorants were not permitted during radiotherapy. The second component comprised a literature search for any existing controlled evidence regarding harm from deodorant use during radiotherapy. Four hundred fourteen women completed surveys. Two hundred eighty recalled advice against deodorants. Two hundred ninety-nine women routinely used deodorants, 70% of whom used roll-on products. Forty-five continued deodorant use during radiation, 20 of these despite recalling advice not to wear a deodorant. Of the 233 women who routinely wore a deodorant but abstained during radiotherapy, 19% expressed a lot of concern about body odour and 45% were slightly concerned. Three controlled studies totalling 310 patients report specific deodorants versus no deodorant use which did not show statistically significantly increased skin reactions, but had only a small subset with axillary irradiation. The proscription of deodorant use during radiotherapy is of unproven benefit and causes body odour concern to the majority of women who are usual deodorant users. The next most appropriate trial would compare use of the usual deodorant versus no deodorant, would encompass a significant number of women with radiotherapy to the axilla or application of deodorant to irradiated skin areas, and include endpoints other than skin reaction alone."

Twenty post-prostatectomy patients treated with conformal prostate bed radiotherapy (64-74 Gy) underwent CBCT daily at fractions 1 to 5, and then weekly. Treatment coverage was defined on each CBCT using 'PTV95', percentage of the CBCT PTV covered by original treatment fields, and 'RECTD50', dose delivered to 50% of CBCT rectal volume by original treatment fields. Three candidate SEVs for treatment coverage were defined for each scan: anterior rectal wall movement, change in bladder length and bladder base movement. Both anterior rectal wall movement and increase in bladder length predicted for the decreased PTV95 (P < 0.001 for each). Anterior movement of the anterior rectal wall predicted for increased RECTD50 (P < 0.001). Predictive models for the PTV95 and RECTD50 that accept the significant SEVs as inputs were developed. We developed simple CBCT-acquired soft tissue anatomic surrogate measures that signal changes in target coverage and rectal dose during post-prostatectomy radiotherapy. Conventional bony anatomy patient position verification protocols were inadequate in accounting for soft tissue target and organ variation seen with CBCT."

However, because of safety concerns and frequent \"off-label\" use data from \"real life,\" registries are necessary to monitor indications and outcome of DES in daily clinical practice.Methods and results:We evaluated data from the German Cypher Stent Registry. A total of 10,894 patients treated with at least one sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) at 152 hospitals were included. Follow-up at a median of 6.4 months was available in 10,006 patients (92%). Median age was 64.8 years and 75.5% were male. Per lesion a mean of 1.09 +/- 0.41 SES were implanted with a mean length of 21.1 +/- 11.5mm. During follow-up, death rate was 1.8% and the rates of myocardial infarction or stroke were 2.1% and 0.5%. Any target vessel revascularization (TVR) was performed in 8.0% of patients. Independent predictors for death, myocardial infarction, or stroke were: cardiogenic shock, acute coronary syndromes, reduced left ventricular function, renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, advanced age, three-vessel disease, degree of stenosis, and prior myocardial infarction. Predictors for a TVR were: two- or three-vessel disease, target vessel = coronary bypass, advanced age, stent diameter, ostial lesions, indication in-stent restenosis, renal failure, and target vessel = left anterior descended artery.Conclusions:These results demonstrate that SES use in clinical practice is safe and effective. The main predictors of clinical events during follow-up are clinical parameters whereas as predictors of TVR mainly are angiographic parameters."

        "Abstract": "Introduction:Despite pharmacological advances for heart failure, morbidity and mortality remain unacceptably high. As a result, alternative approaches such as cell therapy have been suggested to hold potential promise. However, a major obstacle is the optimization of cell delivery to the heart. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy of a percutaneous recirculation system for the delivery of cells to the heart.Methods:Ovine fibroblasts were delivered to the ovine heart (3 x 10(7) cells) using the V-Focus system, a \"closed\" recirculatory system that draws blood from the coronary sinus and returns it to the coronary artery via an oxygenator, or intracoronary (IC) infusion, followed by a 2-hour recovery period. Animals were euthanized and cardiac tissue collected to determine presence of cells.Results:There was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in the number of cells delivered to the heart by the V-Focus compared to direct coronary infusion for left ventricular freewall (V-Focus 1.39 +/- 0.63/mm(2), IC 0.11 +/- 0.06/mm(2)), septum (V-Focus 3.18 +/- 0.88/mm(2), IC 0.38 +/- 0.19/mm(2)), and right ventricle (V-Focus 0.46 +/- 0.23/mm(2), IC 0.05 +/- 0.04/mm(2)).Conclusions:These results suggest that potential therapeutic cells are optimally delivered to the large animal heart using the V-Focus cardiac delivery system in an ovine heart."

        "Abstract": "Although manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element for human development and growth, chronic exposure to excessive Mn levels can result in psychiatric and motor disturbances, referred to as manganism. However, there are no known mechanism(s) for efflux of excess Mn from mammalian cells. Here, we test the hypothesis that the cytoplasmic iron (Fe) exporter ferroportin (Fpn) may also function as a Mn exporter to attenuate Mn toxicity. Using an inducible human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cell model, we examined the influence of Fpn expression on Mn-induced cytotoxicity and intracellular Mn concentrations. We found that induction of an Fpn-green fluorescent protein fusion protein in HEK293T cells was cytoprotective against several measures of Mn toxicity, including Mn-induced cell membrane leakage and Mn-induced reductions in glutamate uptake. Fpn-green fluorescent protein mediated cytoprotection correlated with decreased Mn accumulation following Mn exposure. Thus, Fpn expression reduces Mn toxicity concomitant with reduced Mn accumulation. To determine if mammalian cells may utilize Fpn in response to increased intracellular Mn concentrations and toxicity, we assessed endogenous Fpn levels in Mn-exposed HEK293T cells and in mouse brain in vivo. We find that 6 h of Mn exposure in HEK293T cells is associated with a significant increase in Fpn levels. Furthermore, mice exposed to Mn showed an increase in Fpn levels in both the cerebellum and cortex. Collectively, these results indicate that (i) Mn exposure promotes Fpn protein expression, (ii) Fpn expression reduces net Mn accumulation, and (iii) reduces cytotoxicity associated with exposure to this metal."

        "Abstract": "In the present study, we characterized the Ca2+ responses and secretions induced by various secretagogues in mouse chromaffin cells. Activation of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) by carbachol induced a transient intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)) increase followed by two phases of [Ca2+](i) decay and a burst of exocytic events. The contribution of the subtypes of AChRs to carbachol-induced responses was examined. Based on the results obtained by stimulating the cells with the nicotinic receptor (nAChR) agonist, 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide, high K(+) and the effects of thapsigargin, it appears that activation of nAChRs induces an extracellular Ca2+ influx, which in turn activate Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release via the ryanodine receptors. Muscarine, a muscarinic receptor (mAChRs) agonist, was found to induce [Ca2+](i) oscillation and sustained catecholamine release, possibly by activation of both the receptor- and store-operated Ca2+ entry pathways. The RT-PCR results showed that mouse chromaffin cells are equipped with messages for multiple subtypes of AChRs, ryanodine receptors and all known components of the receptor- and store-operated Ca2+ entry. Furthermore, results obtained by directly monitoring endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration and by disabling mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake suggest that the ER acts as a Ca2+ source, while the mitochondria acts as a Ca2+ sink. Our results show that both nAChRs and mAChRs contribute to the initial carbachol-induced [Ca2+](i) increase which is further enhanced by the Ca2+ released from the ER mediated by Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release and mAChR activation. This information on the Ca2+ signaling pathways should lay a good foundation for future studies using mouse chromaffin cells as a model system."

        "Abstract": "Detection of occult hepatitis B requires assays of the highest sensitivity and specificity with a lower limit of detection of less than 10 IU/mL for hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and <0.1 ng/mL for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). This covert condition is relatively common in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) that seems to exert some influence on the replicative capacity and latency of HBV. Detection of virus-specific nucleic acid does not always translate into infectivity, and the occurrence of primer-generated HBV DNA that is of partial genomic length in immunocompetent individuals who have significant levels of hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) may not be biologically relevant. Acute flares of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) that occur during the early phase of therapy for HCV or ALT levels that remain elevated at the end of therapy in biochemical nonresponders should prompt an assessment for occult hepatitis B. Similarly, the plasma from patients with chronic hepatitis C that is hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive (+/-anti-HBs at levels of <100 mIU/mL) should be examined for HBV DNA with the most sensitive assay available. If a liver biopsy is available, immunostaining for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) should be contemplated and a portion of the sample tested for HBV DNA. This is another reason for optimal collection of a specimen (e.g. two passes with a 16-guage needle under ultrasound guidance). Transmission of HBV to immunosuppressed orthotopic liver transplant recipients by donors with occult hepatitis B (OHB) will continue to occupy the interests of the transplant hepatologist. As patients with OHB may have detectable HBV DNA in serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and/or liver that can be reactivated following immunosuppression or intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy, the patient needs to be either monitored or treated depending on the pretreatment serological results such as an isolated anti-HBc reaction or a detectable HBV DNA."

        "Abstract": "The acute-on-chronic liver failure (AoCLF) caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains to be a challenge in clinics with a high mortality rate in China, and it is important to identify biomarkers to foresee the prognosis of patients with HBV. The current study analysed serum proteome changes of acute-on-chronic liver failure as a result of acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B infection. Serum samples were collected from normal subjects (NS, n = 8), patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB, n = 12) and patients with AoCLF (n = 12). After removal of albumin/IgG and ultramembrane centrifugation, serum proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Differentially expressed spots were identified by matrix-associated laser desorption ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. Through the removal of albumin/IgG and ultramembrane centrifugation, the well-resolved and reproducible two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) profiles were obtained. A total of 23 proteins were identified on 2-DE profiles by their differential expression between the three cohorts. Mass spectrometry analysis resulted in the identification of 12 proteins unambiguously. Western blot analysis confirmed the proteomics results that the α1-acid glycoprotein (α1-AGP) levels decrease significantly in plasma of patients with AoCLF, but somewhat decreased in patients with chronic HBV. Further α1-AGP levels in bulk serum samples were measured by immune turbidimetry including normal subjects group (n = 25), acute hepatitis group (n = 36), chronic hepatitis group (n = 52) and AoCLF group (n = 48), the level of α1-AGP in AoCLF groups sharply decrease than other groups. Our study shows that α1-AGP may be a potential plasma biomarker for AoCLF diagnosis because of acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B infection."

Between 11/2003 and 12/2005, HBV-R occurred in 7/84 HBsAg-negative/anti-HBcAb-positive patients treated for haematological or solid cancer. Virological factors including HBV genotype, core promoter, precore, and HBsAg genotypic and amino acid (aa) patterns were studied. Patients presenting with reactivation were men, had an hepatitis B virus surface antibody (HBsAb) titre <100 IU/L and underwent >1 line of chemotherapy (CT) significantly more frequently than controls. All were treated for haematological cancer, 3/7 received haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and 4/7 received rituximab. Using multivariate analysis, receiving >1 line of CT was an independent risk factor for HBV-R. Fatal outcome occurred in 3/7 patients (despite lamivudine therapy in two), whereas 2/4 survivors had an HBsAg seroconversion. HBV-R involved non-A HBV genotypes and core promoter and/or precore HBV mutants in all cases. Mutations known to impair HBsAg antigenicity were detected in HBV DNA from all seven patients. HBV DNA could be retrospectively detected in two patients prior cancer treatment and despite HBsAg negativity. HBV-R is a concern in HBsAg-negative/anti-HBcAb-positive patients undergoing cancer therapy, especially in males presenting with haematological cancer, a low anti-HBsAb titre and more than one chemotherapeutic agent. HBV DNA testing is mandatory to improve diagnosis and management of HBV-R in these patients. The role of specific therapies such as rituximab or HSCT as well as of HBV aa variability deserves further studies."

        "Abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection results in several changes in mitochondrial function including increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and greater sensitivity to oxidant, Ca(2+) and cytokine-induced cell death. Prior studies in protein over-expression systems have shown that this effect can be induced by the core protein, but other viral proteins and replication events may contribute as well. To evaluate the specific role of core protein in the context of viral replication and infection, we compared mitochondrial sensitivity in Huh7-derived HCV replicon bearing cells with or without core protein expression with that of cells infected with the JFH1 virus strain. JFH1 infection increased hydrogen peroxide production and sensitized cells to oxidant-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cell death. An identical phenomenon occurred in genome-length replicons-bearing cells but not in cells bearing the subgenomic replicons lacking core protein. Both cell death and mitochondrial depolarization were Ca(2+) dependent and could be prevented by Ca(2+) chelation. The difference in the mitochondrial response of the two replicon systems could be demonstrated even in isolated mitochondria derived from the two cell lines with the 'genome-length' mitochondria displaying greater sensitivity to Ca(2+) -induced cytochrome c release. In vitro incubation of 'subgenomic' mitochondria with core protein increased oxidant sensitivity to a level similar to that of mitochondria derived from cells bearing genome-length replicons. These results indicate that increased mitochondrial ROS production and a reduced threshold for Ca(2+) and ROS-induced permeability transition is a characteristic of HCV infection. This phenomenon is a direct consequence of core protein interactions with mitochondria and is present whenever core is expressed, either in infection, full-length replicon-bearing cells, or in over-expression systems."

        "Abstract": "Many patients chronically infected by hepatitis C virus (HCV) experience symptoms like fatigue, dyspnea and reduced physical activity. However, in many patients, these symptoms are not proportional to the liver involvement and could resemble symptoms of chronic heart failure. To our knowledge, no study evaluated serum levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in a large series of patients with HCV chronic infection (HCV+). Serum NT-proBNP was assayed in 50 patients HCV+ and in 50 sex- and age-matched controls. HCV+ patients showed significantly higher mean NT-proBNP level than controls (P = 0.001). By defining high NT-proBNP level as a value higher than 125 pg/mL (the single cut-off point for patient under 75 years of age), 34% HCV+ and 6% controls had high NT-proBNP (Fisher exact test; P < 0.001). With a cut-off point of 300 pg/mL (used to rule out chronic heart failure in patients under 75 years of age) 10% HCV+ and 0 controls had high NT-proBNP (Fisher exact test; P = 0.056). With a cut-off point of 900 pg/mL (used for ruling in chronic heart failure in patients with age 50-75) 8% HCV+ patients and 0 controls had high NT-proBNP (Fisher exact test; P = 0.12). The study demonstrates high levels of circulating NT-proBNP in HCV+ patients compared to healthy controls. The increase of NT-proBNP may indicate the presence of a sub-clinical cardiac dysfunction. Further prospective studies quantifying these symptoms in correlation with echocardiography are needed to confirm this association."

This study was performed to explore the relationship between chronic HBV infection and rubella susceptibility in the obstetric population. We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 50556 pregnant women delivered in a university obstetric unit from January 1998 to June 2008. The incidence of rubella susceptibility according to maternal HBV carrier status was examined. HBV infection and rubella susceptibility were found in 5105 (10.1%) and 6102 (12.1%) women, respectively. Rubella susceptibility was more common in women with HBV (13.1%vs 12.0%, P = 0.017), even after adjusting for other confounding factors (odds ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.21). Advancing age was associated with progressively decreasing odds of rubella susceptibility, from 0.48 at age 20-24 years to 0.34 at age ≥ 40 years in women without HBV infection, but had no effect in women with hepatitis B. In conclusion, our study is the first to demonstrate an association between chronic HBV infection with rubella susceptibility. Further studies are warranted to confirm whether chronic HBV infection, especially that acquired by vertical transmission, may impair the immune response to rubella vaccine or natural infection throughout the reproductive age."

Approximately 50% of patients with CH-C treated with pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin (PEG-IFN-α + RBV) achieve a sustained virological response (SVR). Several factors such as genotype 1, African American (AA) race, obesity and the absence of an early virological response (EVR) are associated with low SVR. This study elucidates molecular pathways deregulated in patients with CH-C with negative predictors of response to antiviral therapy. Sixty-eight patients with CH-C who underwent a full course of treatment with PEG-IFN-α + RBV were included in the study. Pretreatment blood samples were collected in PAXgene™ RNA tubes. EVR, complete EVR (cEVR), and SVR rates were 76%, 57% and 41%, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from pretreatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells, quantified and used for one-step RT-PCR to profile 154 mRNAs. The expression of mRNAs was normalized with six 'housekeeping' genes. Differentially expressed genes were separated into up and downregulated gene lists according to the presence or absence of a risk factor and subjected to KEGG Pathway Painter which allows high-throughput visualization of the pathway-specific changes in expression profiles. The genes were consolidated into the networks associated with known predictors of response. Before treatment, various genes associated with core components of the JAK/STAT pathway were activated in the cohorts least likely to achieve SVR. Genes related to focal adhesion and TGF-β pathways were activated in some patients with negative predictors of response. Pathway-centred analysis of gene expression profiles from treated patients with CH-C points to the Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription signalling cascade as the major pathogenetic component responsible for not achieving SVR. In addition, focal adhesion and TGF-β pathways are associated with some predictors of response."

The aim of this study was to achieve sustained cellular immune responses in vivo to a HCV nonstructural protein using dendritic cell (DC)-based immunization approach. We targeted the HCV NS5 protein to DCs in vivo by injecting microparticles loaded with this antigen. The DC population was expanded in BALB/C mice (H-2(d) ) by hydrodynamic injection of a plasmid pUMVC3-hFLex expressing the secreted portion of the human Fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 ligand (hFlt3). Mice were subsequently injected with microparticles coated with HCV NS5 protein via the tail vein. Cellular immune responses were determined with respect to secretion of INFγ and IL2 by CD4(+) cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) assays in vitro; inhibition of tumour cell growth was employed for the assessment of CD8(+) generated activity in vivo. We found that Flt3L treatment expanded the DC population in the spleen to 43%, and such cells displayed a striking upregulation of CD86 as well as CD80 and CD40 co-stimulating molecules. Viral antigen-specific T(H) 1 cytokine secretion by splenocytes was generated, and CTL activity against syngeneic NS5 expressing myeloma target cells was observed. In addition, these cells inhibited tumour growth indicating that NS5-specific robust CTL activity was operative in vivo. Thus, the capability of activating DCs in vivo using the methods described is valuable as a therapeutic vaccine strategy for chronic HCV infection."

We examined the determinants of serum hepcidin and liver hepcidin mRNA levels and their association with histological lesions in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and healthy controls. We studied 96 patients with CHC and 30 controls. Serum hepcidin levels were measured by an in-house competitive ELISA. Hepcidin mRNA levels were determined by a one-step qRT-PCR in total RNA extracted from liver biopsy specimens of 27 patients with CHC and six disease controls. Histological lesions were evaluated according to Ishak's classification. Serum hepcidin was significantly lower in patients with CHC than healthy controls (14.6 ± 7.3 vs 34.6 ± 17.3 ng/mL, P < 0.001). In patients with CHC, serum hepcidin correlated positively with aspartate aminotransferase (r = 0.334, P = 0.001) and insulin resistance (r = 0.27, P = 0.016) and had a trend for correlation with alanine aminotransferase (r = 0.197, P = 0.057) and serum haemoglobin (r = 0.188, P = 0.067) but not with ferritin. A significant positive correlation was also found between serum hepcidin levels and both necroinflammation (r = 0.259, P = 0.011) and fibrosis (r = 0.214, P = 0.036). Serum hepcidin was among others an independent predictor of cirrhosis (odds ratio: 1.145, P = 0.039). Liver hepcidin mRNA levels did not differ between patients and controls and were relatively lower in patients with than without cirrhosis (19.3 ± 21.7 vs 38.3 ± 26.0, P = 0.067). Patients with CHC have reduced serum hepcidin levels, which correlate with worse necroinflammation and fibrosis. The previously mentioned observations suggest a viral effect on hepatic hepcidin production, but might also support its involvement in the inflammatory process."

        "Abstract": "There are several established risk factors for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), namely primary sclerosing cholangitis, fibropolycystic liver disease, parasitic infection, intrahepatic biliary stones and chemical carcinogen exposure. However, the majority of patients with ICC do not have any of these risk factors. Therefore, identification of other risk factors is warranted for the prevention and early detection of ICC. We evaluated the risk factors for ICC in a large-scale cohort study in the province of Osaka, Japan. This retrospective cohort study included 154,814 apparently healthy individual blood donors, aged 40-64 years at the time of blood donation in the period 1991-1993. The average observation period was 7.6 years, resulting in 1.25 million person-years of observation. Incident ICC cases were identified by linking the blood-donor database to the records in the population-based cancer registry for the province. There were 11 incident ICC cases during follow-up, with an incidence rate of 0.88 per 100,000 person-years. Compared with subjects aged 40-49 years, the subjects aged 50-54 years and 55-59 years had a significantly higher risk for ICC (hazard ratio [HR] = 5.90; 95%CI:1.08-32.31 and 11.07; 95%CI:1.98-61.79, respectively). Compared with those with ALT level of 19 Karmen Units (KU) or less, subjects with ALT level of 40 KU or higher had a significantly higher risk for ICC (HR: 8.30; 95%CI:1.47-46.83). Compared with those who tested negative for both HBsAg and anti-HCV, those who tested HBsAg-positive had a significantly higher risk for ICC (HR: 8.56; 95%CI: 1.33-55.20). Our results suggest that HBV infection and liver inflammation are independently associated with ICC development. These findings need to be verified by further large cohort studies."

        "Abstract": "The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection varies across the world, with the highest number of infections reported in Egypt. Expression of the MxA gene has been found to be a reliable and sensitive marker for the induction of endogenous type I interferons (IFNs) during viral infections. This study examined the correlation of gene expression of MxA with the response to treatment with pegylated-IFN-alfa2b and ribavirin. Fifty patients with type 4 HCV and 20 healthy volunteers as controls were enrolled in a prospective study designed with strict inclusion criteria to nullify the effect of confounding variables and further minimize selection bias. Quantification of HCV-RNA and MxA gene by real-time PCR was performed for every patient, and quantification of MxA gene was performed for controls. There was a statistically significant difference between patients and control group as regards the quantity of MxA gene expression (P < 0.05) (Mann-Whitney test) (P = 0.004). There was a statistically significant difference between responders and nonresponders (P < 0.05): responders showed a higher percentage of cases with initial MxA <2(6) (P < 0.05). We conclude that MxA protein expression is a sensitive biological marker for ongoing virus replication and presence of type 1 IFN. These results highlight the importance of the detection of MxA expression at the start of therapy as a factor for assessing the likelihood of HCV genotype 4 patients to achieving a sustained virological response to treatment with IFN-α2 in combination with ribavirin."

Immigrants from south Asia are common in England and elsewhere, and the burden of viral hepatitis in these communities is unknown. We aimed to determine the prevalence of viral hepatitis in immigrants from south Asia living in England, and we therefore undertook a community-based testing project in such people at five sites in England. A total of 4998 people attending community centres were screened for viral hepatitis using oral fluid testing. The overall prevalence of anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) in people of south Asian origin was 1.6% but varied by country of birth being 0.4%, 0.2%, 0.6% and 2.7% in people of this ethnic group born in the UK, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, respectively. The prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen was 1.2%-0.2%, 0.1%, 1.5% and 1.8% in people of this ethnic group born in the UK, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, respectively. Analysis of risk factors for HCV infection shows that people from the Pakistani Punjab and those who have immigrated recently are at increased risk of infection. Our study suggests that migrants from Pakistan are at highest risk of viral hepatitis, with those from India at low risk. As prevalence varies both by country and region of origin and over time, the prevalence in migrant communities living in western countries cannot be easily predicted from studies in the country of origin."

We investigated the utility of this test as a marker of response to antiviral treatment. Thirty-seven patients with biopsy-proven HCV-related disease undergoing antiviral treatment were studied. All had baseline scans and then repeat scans 6 months after the end of treatment. HVTT using Levovist were obtained from the right and middle hepatic veins, and the shorter time was used for analysis. The aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) scores were calculated retrospectively. There were seven patients with mild hepatitis, 23 with moderate/severe hepatitis and seven with cirrhosis. The mean baseline HVTT in responders ± SE increased from 27.3 ± 2.29 s to 33.5 ± 2.8 s posttreatment (P = 0.01). In the 10 nonresponders, the HVTT remained the same; 43.3 ± 9 s baseline compared to 44 ± 7.8 s posttreatment (P = 0.84). This trend was also seen with the APRI score where in responders, the mean score decreased from 1.1 ± 0.2 to 0.74 ± 1 (P = 0.03) and in nonresponders, the score remained unchanged; 0.88 ± 0.2 compared to 0.84 ± 0.2 (P = 0.31). HVTT measurement lengthened, while APRI scores decreased in patients who responded to antiviral treatment while both remained the same, shortened (HVTT) or increased (APRI), respectively, in patients who were nonresponders. These results are encouraging and indicate that these tests could be potentially used as markers of response to treatment and could obviate the need for serial biopsies in antiviral future treatment studies."

Non-germinated and germinating conidia of Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium verticillioides (Fusarium moniliforme), Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium solani were incubated separately with CAY-1 (0-24.8 μg ml(-1)), silver (0-111.1 μg ml(-1)), and EDTA (0-2400 μg ml(-1)). Controls consisted of non-germinated or germinated conidia in test medium. To assess combined activity, compounds, based on the sub-lethal doses of each as defined in the initial experiments, were combined and tested in bioassays. Controls for the mixed sets consisted of non-germinated or germinated conidia only or with the sub-lethal CAY-1 test concentrations. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for CAY-1 and silver, both separate and combined, were determined. Viability assays showed CAY-1 activity only against the germinating conidia of A. flavus, A. niger and F. solani. Silver was active against the germinating conidia of all fungi and the non-germinated conidia of F. oxysporum and F. solani. Combined silver and CAY-1 produced significant viability loss at concentrations not effective separately. EDTA was not fungicidal separately and did not enhance CAY-1 fungicidal properties. MIC data showed that CAY-1 plus silver had an additive effect. Results indicate that dissolved silver was fungicidal in vitro and enhanced the fungicidal properties of CAY-1 at concentrations ineffective when tested separately."

We undertook a retrospective study of 818 tineas diagnosed in children in a referral hospital between 1977 and 2006, concentrating on TI. Of the 54 TI diagnosed, 85% were in the last 15 years. Most children were older than 9 years of age. The most usual clinical forms were tinea corporis (46.3%) and tinea faciei (38.9%). Topical steroids alone had been used to treat 68.5% of the cases. Direct examination was positive in 91.5% of the cases examined. Culture was positive in 85.2% of cases. The most frequently isolated dermatophyte was Trichophyton mentagrophytes (44.4%). This is the largest case series of childhood TI reported to date. TI has increased over recent years and important differences were found between these TI and the other tineas in children over the same period."

The combination of immunohistochemistry and Western blotting is often used in these cases, but is not always possible if the sample is scarce. We therefore sought to develop a method to quantify relative levels of sarcolemma-associated proteins using digitally captured images of immunolabelled sections of skeletal muscle.Methods:To validate our relative quantification method, we labelled dystrophin and other sarcolemmal proteins in transverse sections of muscle biopsies taken from Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Becker muscular dystrophy patients, a manifesting carrier of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and normal controls.Results:Using this method to quantify relative sarcolemmal protein abundance, we were able to accurately distinguish between the different patients on the basis of the relative amount of dystrophin present.Conclusions:This comparative method adds value to techniques that are already part of the diagnostic process and can be used with minimal variation of the standardized protocols, without using extra amounts of valuable biopsy samples. Comparative quantification of sarcolemmal proteins on immunostained muscle sections will be of use to establish both the abundance and localization of the protein. Moreover, it can be applied to assess the efficacy of experimental therapies where only partial restoration or upregulation of the protein may occur."

Recently, we reported that disruption of the stress-inducible ubiquitin-encoding gene Ubb reduces ubiquitin content in the hypothalamus and leads to adult-onset obesity coupled with a loss of arcuate nucleus neurones and disrupted energy homeostasis in mice. Neuropeptides expressed in the hypothalamus control both metabolic and sleep behaviours. In order to demonstrate that the loss of Ubb results in broad hypothalamic abnormalities, we attempted to determine whether metabolic and sleep behaviours were altered in Ubb knockout mice.Methods:Metabolic rate and energy expenditure were measured in a metabolic chamber, and sleep stage was monitored via electroencephalographic/electromyographic recording. The presence of neurodegeneration and increased reactive gliosis in the hypothalamus were also evaluated.Results:We found that Ubb disruption leads to early-onset reduced activity and metabolic rate. Additionally, we have demonstrated that sleep behaviour is altered and sleep homeostasis is disrupted in Ubb knockout mice. These early metabolic and sleep abnormalities are accompanied by persistent reactive gliosis and the loss of arcuate nucleus neurones, but are independent of neurodegeneration in the lateral hypothalamus.Conclusions:Ubb knockout mice exhibit phenotypes consistent with hypothalamic dysfunction. Our data also indicate that Ubb is essential for the maintenance of the ubiquitin levels required for proper regulation of metabolic and sleep behaviours in mice."

Only two alleles, insensitive Ppd-D1a and sensitive Ppd-D1b, were known previously, and these did not adequately explain the broad adaptation of wheat to photoperiod variation. In this study, five diagnostic molecular markers were employed to identify Ppd-D1 haplotypes in 492 wheat varieties from diverse geographic locations and 55 accessions of Aegilops tauschii, the D genome donor species of wheat. Six Ppd-D1 haplotypes, designated I-VI, were identified. Types II, V and VI were considered to be more ancient and types I, III and IV were considered to be derived from type II. The transcript abundances of the Ppd-D1 haplotypes showed continuous variation, being highest for haplotype I, lowest for haplotype III, and correlating negatively with varietal differences in heading time. These haplotypes also significantly affected other agronomic traits. The distribution frequency of Ppd-D1 haplotypes showed partial correlations with both latitudes and altitudes of wheat cultivation regions. The evolution, expression and distribution of Ppd-D1 haplotypes were consistent evidentially with each other. What was regarded as a pair of alleles in the past can now be considered a series of alleles leading to continuous variation."

Using herbarium specimens, species distribution models, and field collections of sporocarps, root tips and extramatrical mycelia, we assessed the distribution and abundance of the European species Amanita phalloides in North America. There are two distinct ranges of the fungus, one along the West Coast (California to British Columbia) and the second on the East Coast (Maryland to Maine). As predicted by a species distribution model, the West Coast range is larger. Amanita phalloides is more frequently found in native forests on the West Coast than on the East Coast. At Point Reyes Peninsula in California, A. phalloides dominates community sporocarp biomass, and is frequent as root tips. In individual soil cores at Point Reyes, root tips of A. phalloides make up 50% of total root tip biomass. Hyphae of A. phalloides are frequent, but make up only 2% of total hyphal biomass. The contrasting patterns of the distribution and abundance of A. phalloides on the East and West Coasts of North America may influence both its future spread and its impacts."

        "Abstract": "Polyploidization and recombination are two important processes driving evolution through the building and reshaping of genomes. Allopolyploids arise from hybridization and chromosome doubling among distinct, yet related species. Polyploids may display novel variation relative to their progenitors, and the sources of this variation lie not only in the acquisition of extra gene dosages, but also in the genomic changes that occur after divergent genomes unite. Genomic changes (deletions, duplications, and translocations) have been detected in both recently formed natural polyploids and resynthesized polyploids. In resynthesized Brassica napus allopolyploids, there is evidence that many genetic changes are the consequence of homoeologous recombination. Homoeologous recombination can generate novel gene combinations and phenotypes, but may also destabilize the karyotype and lead to aberrant meiotic behavior and reduced fertility. Thus, natural selection plays a role in the establishment and maintenance of fertile natural allopolyploids that have stabilized chromosome inheritance and a few advantageous chromosomal rearrangements. We discuss the evidence for genome rearrangements that result from homoeologous recombination in resynthesized B. napus and how these observations may inform phenomena such as chromosome replacement, aneuploidy, non-reciprocal translocations and gene conversion seen in other polyploids."

During the last decade, attention has been mainly focused on the role of biochemical signals in patterning and morphogenesis, leaving the contribution of mechanics largely unexplored. Fortunately, the development of new tools and approaches has made it possible to re-examine these processes. In plants, shape is defined by two local variables: growth rate and growth direction. At the level of the cell, these variables depend on both the cell wall and turgor pressure. Multidisciplinary approaches have been used to understand how these cellular processes are integrated in the growing tissues. These include quantitative live imaging to measure growth rate and direction in tissues with cellular resolution. In parallel, stress patterns have been artificially modified and their impact on strain and cell behavior been analysed. Importantly, computational models based on analogies with continuum mechanics systems have been useful in interpreting the results. In this review, we will discuss these issues focusing on the shoot apical meristem, a population of stem cells that is responsible for the initiation of the aerial organs of the plant."

Variation at six nuclear microsatellite loci from 50 populations in southern Belgium was investigated through Mantel tests, partial Mantel tests and spatial analysis of molecular variance. Overall patterns of genotypic variation showed strong differentiation among populations at a regional scale (F(ST) = 0.57). The high values of F(IS) observed within populations at both the ramet and genet levels, and the higher proportion of ramets with the same genotype than expected by chance, all point to a strongly clonal or selfing mating system. A genetic discontinuity was identified between northern and southern groups of populations. Within each group, F(ST) and geographical distances were significantly correlated. Partial Mantel tests suggest that genetic and ecological distances are significantly correlated in the southern group. The results point to strong dispersal limitation at the landscape scale and suggest that the southern and northern groups experienced different histories. Within the former, the correlation between genetic and ecological variation is suggestive of reproductive isolation among ecotypes."

        "Abstract": "Experimental evidence demonstrates a higher efficiency of water and nitrogen use in C(4) compared with C(3) plants, which is hypothesized to drive differences in biomass allocation between C(3) and C(4) species. However, recent work shows that contrasts between C(3) and C(4) grasses may be misinterpreted without phylogenetic control. Here, we compared leaf physiology and growth in multiple lineages of C(3) and C(4) grasses sampled from a monophyletic clade, and asked the following question: which ecophysiological traits differ consistently between photosynthetic types, and which vary among lineages? C(4) species had lower stomatal conductance and water potential deficits, and higher water-use efficiency than C(3) species. Photosynthesis and nitrogen-use efficiency were also greater in C(4) species, varying markedly between clades. Contrary to previous studies, leaf nitrogen concentration was similar in C(4) and C(3) types. Canopy mass and area were greater, and root mass smaller, in the tribe Paniceae than in most other lineages. The size of this phylogenetic effect on biomass partitioning was greater in the C(4) NADP-me species than in species of other types. Our results show that the phylogenetic diversity underlying C(4) photosynthesis is critical to understanding its functional consequences. Phylogenetic bias is therefore a crucial factor to be considered when comparing the ecophysiology of C(3) and C(4) species."

        "Abstract": "Plant receptor-like kinases belong to a large gene family. The Capsicum annuum receptor-like kinase 1 (CaRLK1) gene encodes a transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic kinase domain and an extracellular domain. The CaRLK1 extracellular domain (ECD)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was targeted to the plasma membrane, and the kinase domain of the CaRLK1 protein exhibited autophosphorylation activity. CaRLK1 transcripts were more strongly induced in treatment with Xag8ra than in treatment with Xag8-13. Furthermore, infection with incompatible Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria race 3 induced expression of CaRLK1 more strongly than in the compatible interaction. Cell death caused by both a disease-forming and an HR-inducing pathogen was delayed in the CaRLK1-transgenic plants. Ectopic expression of CaRLK1 also induced transcripts of the lesion stimulating disease (LSD) gene, a negative regulator of cell death. Respiratory burst oxidase homolog (RBOH) genes were up-regulated in the transgenic plants compared with the wild type, as the concentration of the superoxide anion was increased. In contrast, the concentration of H(2)O(2) did not differ between the transgenic and wild-type plants. These results support the theory that the suppression of plant cell death by CaRLK1 is associated with consistent production of the superoxide anion and induction of the RBOH genes and the LSD gene, but not with the concentration of H(2)O(2). Thus, CaRLK1 may be a receptor of an as yet unidentified pathogen molecular pattern and may function as a negative regulator of plant cell death."

Using this phylogenetic framework and comparisons with expression changes accompanying F(1) hybridization, we provide a temporal perspective on expression diversification following a shared genome duplication. Global patterns of gene expression were studied by the hybridization of petal RNAs to a custom microarray. This platform measures total expression for c. 42 000 duplicated genes, and genome-specific expression for c. 1400 homoeologs (genes duplicated by polyploidy). We report homoeolog expression bias favoring the allopolyploid D genome over the A genome in all species (among five polyploid species, D biases ranging from c. 54 to 60%), in addition to conservation of biases among genes. Furthermore, we find surprising levels of transgressive up- and down-regulation in the allopolyploids, a diminution of the level of bias in genomic expression dominance but not in its magnitude, and high levels of rate variation among allotetraploid species. We illustrate how phylogenetic and temporal components of expression evolution may be partitioned and revealed following allopolyploidy. Overall patterns of expression evolution are similar among the Gossypium allotetraploids, notwithstanding a high level of interspecific rate variation, but differ strikingly from the direction of genomic expression dominance patterns in the synthetic F(1) hybrid."

        "Abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) represent an important fraction of plant genomes and are likely to play a pivotal role in fuelling genome reorganization and functional changes following allopolyploidization. Various processes associated with allopolyploidy (i.e. genetic redundancy, bottlenecks during the formation of allopolyploids or genome shock following genome merging) may allow accumulation of TE insertions. Our objective in carrying out a survey of the literature and a comparative analysis across different allopolyploid systems is to shed light on the structural, epigenetic and functional modifications driven by TEs during allopolyploidization and subsequent diploidization. The available evidence indicates that TE proliferation in the short or the long term after allopolyploidization may be restricted to a few TEs, in specific polyploid systems. By contrast, data indicate major structural changes in the TE genome fraction immediately after allopolyploidization, mainly through losses of TE sequences as a result of recombination. Emerging evidence also suggests that TEs are targeted by substantial epigenetic changes, which may impact gene expression and genome stability. Furthermore, TEs may directly or indirectly support the evolution of new functionalities in allopolyploids during diploidization. All data stress allopolyploidization as a shock associated with drastic genome reorganization. Mechanisms controlling TEs during allopolyploidization as well as their impact on diploidization are discussed."

This study compared the antihyperalgesic potencies of leconotide and ziconotide given intravenously alone and in combinations with a potassium channel modulator flupirtine, given intraperitoneally, in a rat model of diabetic neuropathic pain.Design:Rats were given streptozotocin (150 mg/kg ip) to induce diabetic neuropathy and hyperalgesia. Experiments were performed on diabetic rats with >or=30% hyperalgesia to noxious heat. Rats were given each conopeptide alone and with flupirtine. Open field activity monitoring and non-invasive blood pressure measurements were used to define the maximum doses and combinations that caused no side effects. Doses in a range up to maximum no side effect doses were tested for antihyperalgesic effects in rats with hyperalgesia.Results:The maximum no side effect dose of leconotide (2 mg/kg intravenously) caused 51.7% reversal of hyperalgesia compared with 0.4% for the highest no side effect dose of ziconotide (0.02 mg/kg; P < 0.001, one-way anova). Leconotide caused dose-related antihyperalgesic effects that were potentiated by coadministration with flupirtine at doses that were ineffective when given alone. Leconotide (0.02 mg/kg) and flupirtine (5 mg/kg) caused 25.3 +/- 7.6 and -6 +/- 9.5% reversal of hyperalgesia, respectively when given alone but in combination they caused 84.1 +/- 7.2% reversal of hyperalgesia (P < 0.01; one-way anova). No such interaction occurred with ziconotide.Conclusion:Leconotide could have wider clinical applications than ziconotide. Unlike ziconotide, powerful antihyperalgesia without side effects can be achieved by intravenous administration of leconotide thus avoiding the need for an intrathecal injection."

Separate analyses were conducted for patients with and without a diagnosis of a mood disorder or anxiety disorder. Changes in mean dose between 2000 and 2005 were estimated, as were changes in the rate of prescription for different opioid types (short-acting, long-acting, and non-Schedule 2).Patients:Enrollees in HealthCore (N = 2,716,163 in 2000) and Arkansas Medicaid (N = 115,914 in 2000).Results:Within each of the age and sex groups, less than 10% of patients with a chronic pain diagnosis in HealthCore, and less than 33% in Arkansas Medicaid, received long-term opioid prescriptions. All age, sex, and anxiety/depression groups showed similar and statistically significant increases in long-term opioid prescription between 2000 and 2005 (35-50% increase). Per-patient daily doses did not increase.Conclusions:No one group showed especially large increases in long-term opioid prescriptions between 2000 and 2005. These results argue against a recent epidemic of opioid prescribing. These trends may result from increased attention to pain in clinical settings, policy or economic changes, or provider and patient openness to opioid therapy. The risks and benefits to patients of these changes are not yet established."

In a previous study, the Opioid Attractiveness Technology Scaling (OATS) method identified, from a drug abuser's point of view, the particular features of a prescription opioid relevant to its attractiveness for recreational use. A second online sample rated the extent to which these features applied to particular products they had actually used/abused. These data were used to model the abusers' overall preference for prescription opioids they had used/abused.Design:In the present study, this method was applied to a not-yet-marketed ADF using substance abuse counselors as proxies for prescription opioid abusers. Thirty-eight counselors were given materials describing the new ADF along with four known products.Results:Thirty-two counselors demonstrated sufficient agreement with abusers' ratings of the overall attractiveness of these drugs. The overall model yielded a significant pseudo R(2) of 0.15 (P < 0.001), with increasing model fit based on preferred route of administration, from swallowing whole (pseudo R(2) = 0.06; P < 0.001) and best for those who preferred to inject (pseudo R(2) = 0.40; P < 0.001). Data from a cross-validation group of 16 counselors/proxies were used to calculate the OATS scores for the five rated drugs and revealed significant differences between the ADF and OxyContin (Purdue Pharma LP, Stamford, CT), Percocet (Endo Pharmaceuticals, Chadds Ford, PA), and Vicodin (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL), but not Talwin NX (Sanofi-aventis, Bridgewater, NJ), which was identified in the prior study as a highly unattractive drug for recreational purposes.Conclusions:The OATS method shows promise for providing pre-marketing estimates of attractiveness for abuse of not-yet-marketed ADFs."

Recreational prescription opioid users appear to prefer some products over others; however, the extent to which attributes of any particular formulation account for such preferences has yet to be determined. The Opioid Attractiveness Technology Scaling was developed to identify the particular features of a prescription opioid that are relevant to its attractiveness for recreational use, and to use these features to model attractiveness for recreational use of particular prescription opioid formulations.Design:Four hundred and ninety-one self-reported recreational prescription opioid users identified 43 product features as being relevant to determining whether a product is \"attractive\" or \"unattractive\" for recreational use. Average ratings were used to determine appropriate weights to be applied to the features. A factor analysis yielded 10, highly differentiated factors. Five hundred and sixty-four prescription opioid abusers were then asked to rate the extent to which the 43 features identified in Study 1 were relevant to specific prescription opioid products they had used.Results:Respondents provided an overall preference rating of these products and a model was created. A random intercept model yielded a significant pseudo R(2) of 0.14 (chi-square = 310.02, degrees of freedom [df] = 10, P < 0.001). The model fit least well, albeit significantly, for abusers who preferred to swallow the drug (pseudo R(2) = 0.06; chi-square = 55.52, df = 10, P < 0.001) and best for those who preferred to inject (pseudo R(2) = 0.37; chi-square = 199.34, df = 10, P < 0.001).Conclusions:The relevance of the model is discussed along with possible modifications that might allow prediction of \"attractiveness\" of \"abuse deterrent\" formulations that have not yet been marketed."

In this study we show evidence that the palette of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is more complex. Hydrogen peroxide, superoxide and hydroxyl radicals are also formed, suggesting the occurrence of type-I reactions as well. Moreover, hydrogen peroxide injection into the epicotyls in the dark was able to provoke wilting directly. Formation of hydroxyl radicals could also be triggered by the addition of hydrogen peroxide in the dark, preferentially in the mid-sections where wilting occurs, showing that potential mediators of a Fenton reaction are present in the epicotyls, but unevenly distributed. Localization of light-inducible ROS formation fully (hydrogen peroxide) or partially (superoxide radicals) overlaps with the distribution of monomer protochlorophyllide complexes, showing that these pigment forms are capable of provoking both type-I and type-II reactions."

        "Abstract": "Numerous studies have illustrated the need for antioxidant enzymes in acquired photosynthetic thermotolerance, but information on their possible role in promoting innate thermotolerance is lacking. We investigated the hypothesis that genotypic differences in source leaf photosynthetic thermostability would be dependent upon prestress capacity for antioxidant protection of the photosynthetic apparatus in Gossypium hirsutum. To test this hypothesis, thermosensitive (cv. ST4554) and reportedly thermotolerant (cv. VH260) G. hirsutum plants were exposed to control (30/20 degrees C) or high-day temperature (38/20 degrees C) conditions during flowering and source leaf gas exchange, chlorophyll content and maximum photochemical efficiency (F(v)/F(m)) were measured for each treatment. The relationship between source leaf thermostability and prestress antioxidant capacity was quantified by monitoring the actual quantum yield response of photosystem II (PSII) (Phi(PSII)) to a range of temperatures for both cultivars grown under the control temperature regime and measuring antioxidant enzyme activity for those same leaves. VH260 was more thermotolerant than ST4554 as evidenced by photosynthesis and F(v)/F(m) being significantly lower under high temperature for ST4554 but not VH260. Under identical growth conditions, VH260 had significantly higher optimal and threshold temperatures for Phi(PSII) and glutathione reductase (GR; EC 1.8.1.7) activity than ST4554, and innate threshold temperature was dependent upon endogenous GR and superoxide dismutase (SOD; EC 1.15.1.1) activity. We conclude that maintaining a sufficient antioxidant enzyme pool prior to heat stress is an innate mechanism for coping with rapid leaf temperature increases that commonly occur under field conditions."

The precise timing of these emissions upon the onset of herbivore feeding has not been fully elucidated, and the information that is available has been mainly obtained through laboratory based studies. We investigated emissions of VOCs from Populus tremula L. xP. tremuloides Michx. during the first 20 h of feeding by Epirrita autumnata (autumnal moth) larvae in a field site. The study was conducted using Proton Transfer Reaction-Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS) to measure emissions online, with samples collected for subsequent analysis by complementary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for purposes of compound identification. GLV emission peaks occurred sporadically from the outset, indicating herbivore activity, while terpene emissions were induced within 16 h. We present data detailing the patterns of monoterpene (MT), GLV and sesquiterpene (SQT) emissions during the early stages of herbivore feeding showing diurnal MT and SQT emission that is correlated more with temperature than light. Peculiarities in the timing of SQT emissions prompted us to conduct a thorough characterization of the equipment used to collect VOCs and thus corroborate the accuracy of results. A laboratory based analysis of the throughput of known GLV, MT and SQT standards at different temperatures was made with PTR-MS. Enclosure temperatures of 12, 20 and 25 degrees C had little influence on the response time for dynamic measurements of a GLV or MT. However, there was a clear effect on SQT measurements. Elucidation of emission patterns in real-time is dependent upon the dynamics of cuvettes at different temperatures."

Calyces were found to be the main sites of VOC accumulation. The 20 most abundant VOCs could be separated into three sub-groups according to their patterns of change in concentration The three groups of VOCs sequentially dominated the global scent bouquet of inflorescences, the transition between the first and second groups occurring around the opening of the first flower of the inflorescence and the one between the second and third groups at the start of seed set. Changes in calyx VOC accumulation were linked to the developmental stage of individual flowers. Leaves accumulated a smaller number of VOCs which were a subset of those seen in preflowering inflorescences. Their nature and content remained constant during the growing season. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction assessments of the expression of two terpene synthase (TPS) genes, LaLIMS and LaLINS, revealed similar trends between their patterns of expression and those of their VOC products. Molecular and chemical analyses suggest that changes in TPS expression occur during lavender inflorescence development and lead to changes in EO composition. Both molecular data and terpene analysis support the findings that changes in biosynthesis of terpene occurred during inflorescence development."

We have developed a membrane inlet mass spectrometer method that simultaneously determines the rate of Rubisco carboxylation (v(c)) and oxygenation (v(o)), and the CO(2) and O(2) concentrations. Using the collected data, the Michaels-Menten equations for v(c) and v(o) in response to changing CO(2) and O(2) concentrations were simultaneously solved for the CO(2) (K(c)) and O(2) (K(o)) constants, the maximum turnover rates of the enzyme for CO(2) (kcat(CO2)) and O(2) (kcat(O2)) and the specificity for CO(2) relative to O(2) (S(c/o)). In the C(4) species Zea mays K(c) was higher but K(o) was lower compared with the C(3) species Triticum aestivum. The kcat(CO2) was higher and the kcat(O2) lower in Z. mays compared with T. aestivum and S(c/o) was similar in the two species. The V(omax)/V(cmax) was lower in Z. mays and thus did not correlate with changes in S(c/o). In conclusion, this mass spectrometer system provides a means of simultaneously determining the important Rubisco kinetic parameters, K(c), K(o), kcat(CO2,)kcat(O2) and S(c/o) from the same set of assays."

        "Abstract": "During vessel evolution in angiosperms, scalariform perforation plates with many slit-like openings transformed into simple plates with a single circular opening. The transition is hypothesized to have resulted from selection for decreased hydraulic resistance. Previously, additional resistivity of scalariform plates was estimated to be small - generally 10% or less above lumen resistivity - based on numerical and physical models. Here, using the single-vessel technique, we directly measured the hydraulic resistance of individual xylem vessels. The resistivity of simple-plated lumens was not significantly different from the Hagen-Poiseuille (HP) prediction (+6 + or - 3.3% mean deviation). In the 13 scalariform-plated species measured, plate resistivity averaged 99 + or - 13.7% higher than HP lumen resistivity. Scalariform species also showed higher resistivity than simple species at the whole vessel (+340%) and sapwood (+580%) levels. The strongest predictor of scalariform plate resistance was vessel diameter (r(2) = 0.84), followed by plate angle (r(2) = 0.60). An equation based on laminar flow through periodic slits predicted single-vessel measurements reasonably well (r(2) = 0.79) and indicated that Baileyan trends in scalariform plate evolution maintain an approximate balance between lumen and plate resistances. In summary, we found scalariform plates of diverse morphology essentially double lumen flow resistance, impeding xylem flow much more than previously estimated."

        "Abstract": "Late embryogenesis-abundant (LEA) proteins are one of the components involved in desiccation tolerance (DT) by maintaining cellular structures in the dry state. Among them, MtPM25, a member of the group 5 is specifically associated with DT in Medicago truncatula seeds. Its function is unknown and its classification as a LEA protein remains elusive. Here, evidence is provided that MtPM25 is a hydrophobic, intrinsically disordered protein that shares the characteristics of canonical LEA proteins. Screening protective activities by testing various substrates against freezing, heating and drying indicates that MtPM25 is unable to protect membranes but able to prevent aggregation of proteins during stress. Prevention of aggregation was also found for the water soluble proteome of desiccation-sensitive radicles. This inhibition was significantly higher than that of MtEM6, one of the most hydrophilic LEA protein associated with DT. Moreover, when added after the stress treatment, MtPM25 is able to rapidly dissolve aggregates in a non-specific manner. Sorption isotherms show that when it is unstructured, MtPM25 absorbs up to threefold more water than MtEM6. MtPM25 is likely to act as a protective molecule during drying and plays an additional role as a repair mechanism compared with other LEA proteins."

        "Abstract": "More than 100 different studies of plant transcriptomic responses to salinity or drought-related stress have now been published. Most of these use microarrays or related high-throughput profiling technologies. This compels us to ask three questions in review: (1) what has transcriptomics contributed to our understanding of stress physiology; (2) what limits the ability of transcriptomics to contribute to increases in stress tolerance; and (3) given these limits, what are the most appropriate uses of transcriptomics? We conclude that although microarrays are now a mature technology that accurately describes the transcriptome, the consistently low correlation between transcript abundance and other measures of gene expression imposes an inherent limitation that cannot be ignored. Further limitations on the relevance of transcriptomics arise in some cases from experimental practices related to the treatment regimen and the selection of tissue or germplasm. Nevertheless, there is good evidence to support the continued use of transcriptomics, especially emerging techniques such as RNA-Seq, as a screening tool for candidate gene discovery. Microarrays can also be valuable in analysing the transcriptome per se (e.g. when describing the phenotype of a transcription factor mutant or discovering non-coding RNA species), and when integrated with other types of data including metabolomic analyses."

        "Abstract": "Abscisic acid (ABA) affects plant metabolism and water transfers via multiple mechanisms at cell, organ and whole plant levels. These mechanisms translate into contradictory effects on leaf growth, so the literature reports positive, null or negative effects of ABA on leaf growth upon water deficit. We review evidences based on genetic manipulations of ABA biosynthesis, feeding the plant with artificial ABA or partial root drying and provide elements to avoid confusions of effects. We propose that ABA has mainly three effects on growth. (i) Via its controlling effect on stomatal aperture and transpiration rate, an increased concentration of ABA tends to buffer the day-night alternations of leaf growth rate and the negative effect of evaporative demand. (ii) ABA tends to improve leaf growth via an increase in the conductance to water transfer in the plant as a result of increased tissue hydraulic conductivity. (iii) ABA has also a modest non-hydraulic effect which is negative in plants subjected to water deficit, either manipulated for ABA synthesis or fed with artificial ABA, but can be positive in well watered plants deficient of ABA. The overall effect of increasing ABA biosynthesis depends on the relative weight of each of these effects under different environmental scenarios."

The purpose of this study was to describe tobacco use, exposure to second hand smoke (ESHS), and health perceptions of female HTX recipients and examine relationships between these variables of interest and demographic and clinical characteristics of women following HTX. Seventy-two women (mean age, 54.3+/-12.7 years; mean time since transplant, 5.5+/-4.5 years) were enrolled from a single HTX center. Demographic and clinical data, tobacco use, ESHS, and health perceptions were obtained through self-report and chart reviews. Tobacco use was verified by measurement of urine cotinine levels. Twenty-four women were nonsmokers before and after HTX. Eighteen (37.5%) of the 48 women who were former smokers before HTX had returned to tobacco abuse. Only 4 of the 18 accurately reported their smoking behaviors. Forty percent of nonsmokers reported ESHS. Tobacco use and ESHS were highest among African American women. Forty percent of the sample perceived their health status as fair-poor; the remaining 60% reported good-excellent health. In a multivariate analysis, current tobacco use (odds ratio [OR], 5.20; confidence interval [CI], 3.83-9.13) and ESHS (OR, 1.82; CI, 1.17-2.82) were independent predictors of lower health perceptions. Although a majority of the female recipients who used tobacco ceased smoking before HTX, a substantial proportion demonstrated recurrent tobacco use after HTX. Our findings suggest the need for aggressive screening and risk factor interventions to promote smoking cessation before and after HTX in this unique population of female HTX recipients."

The present study investigated the significance of elevated b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), NYHA classification and depression to HF-related QOL to develop better management strategies. Outpatient subjects with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (n=108; mean age=64.9+/-12) completed the self-administered Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Functional status was measured using the New York Heart Association Classification (NYHA) and BNP concentrations were measured in plasma samples. Multiregression analysis determined that plasma BNP levels did not contribute significantly to the total QOL score while depression (r=0.63, t ratio=7.43, P<.0001) and NHYA class (r=0.47, t ratio=3.31, P<.001) were significant contributors. NYHA III subjects exhibited worse depression scores (II 15+/-7 and III: 22+/-10, P<.001) and elevated plasma BNP (II: 2.0+/-0.5 and III: 2.4+/-0.6, P<.001). Low-cost psychological assessments are recommended to evaluate depression and suggest that those HF patients with NYHA III be closely monitored for depression and reduced QOL."

It is not clear if ethnic differences exist in factors associated with psychological well-being. We examined psychosocial factors associated with depression and anxiety in 97 HF patients. Medical records were reviewed and patients (M age 53, 50% African American) completed surveys examining social support, coping, spirituality, and QOL for their association with depression and anxiety. Multiple regressions suggested that psychosocial factors were associated with psychological health. Patients with lower social support, lower meaning/peace and more negative coping reported greater depression; positive coping, and lower meaning/peace were associated with higher anxiety. Ethnicity stratified models suggested that spiritual well-being was associated with depression only among African Americans and QOL partially mediated this relationship. Findings suggest the importance of considering the unique psychosocial needs of diverse populations to appropriately target clinical interventions."

Most (77%) had not discussed sexual concerns with a health care professional (HCP). Sexual concerns that were rated as occurring 'occasionally/frequently' included partner overprotectiveness (63%), partner fear of sex (36%), lack of sexual interest (42%), erectile problems (74%), orgasmic difficulties (51%). Frequency of sexual intercourse before HF to present was striking, with 53% reporting no sexual activity in the last 2 months compared with 11% before diagnosis of HF. HCPs must provide sexual counseling to HF patients and partners to enhance QOL and to assist in any adaptations to sexual activity."

The CICU patient perceived higher value for visiting specifically because visitors assisted with interpretation of information (P<.02), were calming (P<.05), providing information about them to staff (P<.01), helped with care (P<.000), and reinforced treatments (P<.004). There were no differences in total stressor score between CICU and SDU patients, though the CICU patient worried more about their visitors traveling (P<.025). The SDU patient perceived that visitors were disruptive to rest (P<.001) and that visitors intensified their pain (P<.008). The majority of patients preferred unlimited visiting hours, with 3 visitors at a time, and some limits on children. Text data identified unlimited visiting for close family members, the benefit of support from visitors, and the stress of lengthy visits. These data provide voice to cardiovascular patient's perception of visitors."

While there has been a recent interest in conducting meta-analysis and systematic reviews on the effectiveness of patient education during the preoperative period, no review was found on the topic of postoperative CABG patient education. This systematic review addressed the clinically-relevant questions: what approach, mode, and dose is most effective in producing changes in CABG patient education? Studies were included in the systematic review if they met the following selection criteria: (1) the sample represented adult (> or =18 years) patients who underwent CABG surgery; (2) the educational intervention involved the provision of self-care information following surgery but before discharge from hospital; (3) the outcome assessed related to self-care behavior; and (4) the study report was published in English between 1986 and 2008. A descriptive synthesis was used to code and extract data on publication information, study design, sample size, and quality of study, as well as postoperative CABG teaching, self-care behavior performance, and demographic characteristics of the patients who participated in the studies. A quantitative synthesis consisted of a statistical approach, which was used to calculate the magnitude of the treatment effects on self-care behavior. Results indicated larger effect sizes for CABG patient education in which the content was individualized, and given in a combination of media on an individual basis, and in more than one session."

Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) (Lp-PLA(2)) is an enzyme produced in atherosclerotic plaque and is bound to low density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. It has a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by promoting vascular inflammation. It is emerging as a vascular-specific marker and predictor of risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Increasing evidence from many prospective epidemiologic studies have shown that elevated levels of Lp-PLA(2) are associated with future CVD events. Measurement of Lp-PLA(2) in individuals may provide clinically relevant information about their future risk of CVD events. Pharmacologic therapies and/or risk factor modification could be initiated after identification of individuals at risk for CVD. This review provides an overview of the pathophysiology, epidemiologic evidence, and clinical utility of Lp-PLA(2)."

There is substantial evidence on the relationship between diet and CVD risk. An understanding of how genetic variation interacts with the diet to influence CVD risk is a rapidly evolving area of research. Since diet is the mainstay of risk factor modification, it is important to consider potential genetic influences on CVD risk. Nutrigenomics is the study of the interaction between diet and an individual's genetic makeup. Single nucleotide polymorphisms are the key factors in human genetic variation and provide a molecular basis for phenotypic differences between individuals. Whole genome and candidate gene association studies are two main approaches used in cardiovascular genetics to identify disease-causing genes. Recent nutrigenomics studies show the influence of genotype on the responsiveness to dietary factors or nutrients that may reduce CVD risk. Nutrigenomics research is expected to provide the scientific evidence for genotype-based personalized nutrition to promote health and prevent chronic disease, including CVD. It is imperative that healthcare providers, including cardiovascular nurses, are trained in genetics to foster delivery of competent genetic- and genomic-focused care and to facilitate incorporation of this new knowledge into current clinical practice, education, and research."

In principle, Golgi-associated PKA could participate in either signal transduction events and/or the coordination of Golgi transport activities. Here, we show data indicating that although Golgi-associated PKA is activated fast and efficiently during cell stimulation by an extracellular ligand it does not contribute significantly to cAMP signal transmission to the nucleus. Instead, most of the PKA catalytic subunits Calphaderived from the Golgi complex remain localized in the perinuclear cytoplasm where they induce changes in Golgi structural organization. Thus, in stimulated cells the Golgi complex appears collapsed, showing increased colocalization of previously segregated markers and exhibiting merging of different proximal cisternae within a single stack. In contrast, the trans-Golgi network remains as a separate compartment. Consequently, the rate of protein transport is increased whereas glycan processing is not severely affected. This remodeling process requires the presence of PKA activity associated to the Golgi membranes. Together these data indicate that Golgi-associated PKA activity is involved in the adaptation of Golgi dynamic organization to extracellular signaling events."

        "Abstract": "Caveolae are invaginations of the plasma membrane involved in multiple cellular processes, including transcytosis. In this paper we present an extensive 3-D electron tomographic study of the endothelial caveolar system in situ. Analysis of large cellular volumes of (high-pressure frozen, freeze-substituted and epon-embedded) human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) provided a notable view on the architecture of the caveolar system that comprises--as confirmed by 3-D immunolabeling for caveolin of 'intact' cells--bona fide caveolae, free plasmalemmal vesicles, racemose invaginations and free multi-caveolar bodies. Application of template matching to tomograms allowed the 3-D localization of caveolar membrane coatings in a robust manner. In this way we observed that bona fide endothelial caveolae, cryofixed and embedded in their cellular context, show a spiral organization of the coating as shown in the past for chemically fixed and freeze-etched caveolae from fibroblasts. Meticulous 3-D analysis further revealed that the coatings are distributed in triads of spirals over the caveolar bulb and neck. Remarkably, this coating distribution is consistently present over the membranes of the other members of the caveolar system in HUVECs. The novel observations that we present clarify the ultrastructural complexity of the 'intact' caveolar system, setting a detailed morphological basis for its functional diversity."

        "Abstract": "We report 4 renal transplant recipients with erythema nodosum. Erythema nodosum is a cutaneous inflammatory reaction located on the anterior aspects of the lower extremities. It may be associated with a wide variety of diseases, including infections (as in Cases 1 and 2), sarcoidosis, rheumatologic diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases (as in Case 3), medications (as in Case 4), autoimmune disorders, pregnancy, and malignancies. Histopathologically, erythema nodosum is the stereotypical example of a mostly septal panniculitis with no vasculitis, and the inflammatory infiltrate in the septa varies with age of the lesion. In early lesions edema, hemorrhage, and neutrophils are responsible for the septal thickening, whereas fibrosis, peri-septal granulation tissue, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells are the main findings in late stage. Etiological management - by anti-tuberculous therapy in Cases 1 and 2, by salazopyrin in Case 3, and by discontinuation of ciprofloxacin in Case 4 - was associated with regression. Erythema nodosum can develop in renal transplant patients who did not receive induction therapy, non-rejecters, and those with steroid-free protocols. Management of erythema nodosum should be directed to the underlying associated condition, which could be tuberculosis, inflammatory bowel disease, or drug related."

Clinical trials and comparative cohort studies comparing the use of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg), antivirals, or both following liver transplantation for HBV infection were included. The primary outcome was reappearance of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Other outcomes included all-cause and HBV-related mortality, HB-related active liver disease, and reappearance of HBV DNA after transplantation. Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported.Results:Twenty studies (22 comparisons) were included. Ten studies compared HBIg to combination treatment, 9 compared antivirals to combination treatment, and 3 compared lamivudine (LAM) to HBIg. Combination treatment reduced HBsAg reappearance (RR 0.28; 95% CI 0.12-0.66), and was superior to HBIg alone in all other outcome measures. Combination treatment was significantly better than antivirals in preventing reappearance of HBsAg (RR 0.31; 95% CI 0.22-0.44), even when low-dose HBIg was given. No significant difference was found between HBIg and LAM monotherapy for all measured outcomes. Major limitations with regard to comparability of the study groups in non-randomized trials were revealed.Conclusions:Combination treatment with HBIg and LAM reduced HBV recurrence following liver transplantation, compared with HBIg or LAM alone, and reduced mortality compared with HBIg alone."

Renal transplant patients received GCV on days 1-2, valganciclovir 260 mg/m(2) on day 3, and valganciclovir 520 mg/m(2) on day 4. Liver transplant patients received twice daily GCV from enrollment to day 12, and then valganciclovir twice daily on days 13-14. GCV pharmacokinetics were described using a population pharmacokinetic approach. Type of solid organ transplant (kidney or liver) had no effect on GCV pharmacokinetics. Median GCV exposure following valganciclovir 520 mg/m(2) was similar to that with IV GCV, and to that reported in adults. Patients <5 years of age had AUC values approximately 50% of those compared with older age ranges; dosing based on both BSA and CrCL increased drug exposure in younger patients. A dosing algorithm based on BSA and CrCL should be tested in future studies."

Up to 10% of SCT recipients develop invasive aspergillosis (IA). Invasive zygomycosis (IZ) may occur during treatment against IA. Here we report 4 SCT patients with GVHD diagnosed with IZ. All patients had received myeloablative hematopoietic SCT and developed chronic GVHD requiring systemic immunosuppression. Underlying diseases were acute lymphocytic leukemia (2), osteomyelofibrosis, and multiple myeloma. All patients had developed pulmonary infiltration that led to initiation of antifungal therapy. Treatment for IA was voriconazole, caspofungin, or itraconazole. Organs involved with zygomycosis were lung, nasal sinus, skin, and kidney. Treatment with liposomal amphotericin and posaconazole was initiated in all patients, and 2 patients also had surgical debridement as well. Despite intensive treatment, no patient survived. IZ is becoming more common in patients with GVHD on successful treatment for IA. Even non-specific symptoms are suspicious in this group of patients and need to be evaluated by vigorous diagnostics. Despite effective antifungals and surgical intervention, the prognosis is grim in patients with active GVHD, as immunoreconstitution is mandatory for successful management."

To characterize the early and late outcome after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for POD in the Scottish Liver Transplant Unit over a 14-year period (1992-2006). Data were obtained from a prospective database combined with case-note review. Of 127 liver transplants performed for ALF, 44 were for POD. The median age was 30 (range 18-51). In 18 patients (63.7%), POD was associated with alcohol/other drugs, nine (20.5%) had a staggered overdose and four patients (9.1%) accidentally overdosed. Nineteen patients (43.2%) had a history of previous overdose/psychiatric illness. Post-transplant mortality during the index admission was 30% (13 patients), whilst five patients died during follow-up. The actuarial 5-year patient survival was 54.5%, whilst graft survival was 49.5%. Some 23% of the patients were re-transplanted: primary nonfunction (1), hepatic artery thrombosis (3) and chronic rejection (2). Three patients had a subsequent transplant; three patients had two further transplants. Nine patients (35%) continue to have social/psychiatric issues. OLT for POD is associated with significant early and late morbidity and mortality. A multidisciplinary approach is required to identify the suitable candidates, in whom transplantation should be pursued promptly."

The fraction of patients who need intravascular volume to establish a maximal SV has, however, not been evaluated, and there are only limited data on the volume required to establish a maximal SV before the start of surgery. Therefore, we estimated the occurrence and size of the potential functional intravascular volume deficit in surgical patients.Methods:Patients scheduled for mastectomy (n=20), open radical prostatectomy (n=20), or open major abdominal surgery (n=20) were anaesthetized, and before the start of surgery, a 200 ml colloid fluid challenge was provided and repeated if a >or=10% increment in SV estimated by oesophageal Doppler was established. The volume needed for SV maximization defined the intravascular volume deficit.Results:Forty-two (70%) of the patients needed volume to establish a maximal SV. For the patients needing volume, the required amount was median 200 ml (range 200-600 ml), with no significant difference between the three groups of patients. The required volume was >or=400 ml in nine patients (15%).Conclusion:The majority of anaesthetized patients present with a functional intravascular volume deficit before surgery. Although the deficit in general was minor, a fraction of patients presented with a deficit that may be of clinical relevance, emphasizing the importance of the individual approach of goal-directed fluid therapy."

        "Abstract": "Background:After using propofol for a decade, pain on injection had been considered routine by patients and medical personnel. When given propofol from a different manufacturer, patients did not complain. Two preparations of propofol were compared.Methods:A comparative, double-blind, randomized study was conducted in 22 adult patients undergoing pain relief procedures; they received sedation by an intravenous injection of 1.7 mg/kg of propofol and then were treated with paravertebral injections. Pain on injection was assessed by verbal complaint, movement of the extremity, of the whole body and recollection of pain at induction, when discharged. Propofol from Baxter Laboratories, mixed with either 5 ml of 2% lidocaine or 5 ml of NaCl 0.9%, was compared with propofol Laboratorios Gray, which was similarly mixed. Injections were randomly administered four times, blindly, to each of 22 patients. Statistical analysis was conducted using the analysis of variance method.Results:A total of 352 propofol injections were given. Each of the four propofol solutions was administered 88 times; of patients receiving Baxter propofol+saline, 74 (84%) had pain; when mixed with 2% lidocaine 45 (50.2%) complained. After propofol Gray with NaCl 0.9% was given, two patients (2.2%) experienced pain. Propofol Gray with 2% lidocaine produced no pain. None of the latter group remembered having pain, whereas, those given propofol Baxter 54 (61.3%) and 26 (29.5%) remembered experiencing pain at injection. Pain on injection was prevented and statistically reduced (<0.01) with the propofol from Laboratorios Gray.Conclusions:By changing the formulation (size of molecules and their dispersion) of propofol, pain on injection was avoided."

The use of a sedation scale to continually evaluate the patient's response to sedation may promote earlier extubation and may subsequently have a positive effect on the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). The Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) provides 10 well-defined levels divided into two different segments, including criteria for levels of sedation and agitation. Previous studies of the RASS have shown it to have strong reliability and validity. The aim of this study was to translate the RASS into Swedish and to test the inter-rater reliability of the scale in a Swedish ICU.Methods:A translation of the RASS from English into Swedish was carried out, including back-translation, critical review and pilot testing. The inter-rater reliability testing was conducted in a general ICU at a university hospital in the south of Sweden, including 15 patients mechanically ventilated and sedated. Forty in-pair assessments using the Swedish version of the RASS were performed and the inter-rater reliability was tested using weighted kappa statistics (linear weighting).Result:The translation of the RASS was successful and the Swedish version was found to be satisfactory and applicable in the ICU. When tested for inter-rater reliability, the weighed kappa value was 0.86.Conclusion:This study indicates that the Swedish version of the RASS is applicable with good inter-rater reliability, suggesting that the RASS can be useful for sedation assessment of patients mechanically ventilated in Swedish general ICUs."

Eight novel SNPs were identified, which were AJ276223:g.2064T>A (SNP1), g.2155C>T (SNP2), g.2203G>T (SNP3), g.2268T>C (SNP4), g.2274G>A (SNP5), g.2340A>G (SNP6), g.2350T>C (SNP7) and g.2370A>G (SNP8). Complete linkage disequilibrium was observed among SNP1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8. Phenotypic data were collected from 573 cross-bred steers with six sire breeds, including Hereford, Angus, Brangus, Beefmaster, Bonsmara and Romosinuano. The genotypes of SNP1/2/4/5/6/8 were significantly associated with adjusted backfat thickness. The genotypes of SNP3 were significantly associated with triacylglycerol (TAG) content and fatty acid composition of longissimus dorsi muscle (LM) in Brangus-, Romosinuano- and Bonsmara-sired cattle. Cattle with g.2203GG genotype had greater concentrations of TAG, total lipid, total saturated fatty acid and total monounsaturated fatty acid than did cattle with g.2203GT genotype. The genotypes of SNP7 were significantly associated with fatty acid composition of LM. Cattle with genotype g.2350TC had greater amounts of several fatty acids in LM than did cattle with genotype g.2350CC. Our results suggested that the SNPs in the PI region of ACACA gene are associated with variations in the fatty acid contents in LM."

This included ovarian/primary peritoneal cancer in 186 women (71%). Of these 262 cases, 238 operations (91%) were performed by a gynaecological oncologist, 20 (7.5%) were performed jointly with the gastrointestinal surgeons and four (1.5%) were performed solely by the gastrointestinal surgeons. A gynaecological oncology subspecialty fellow performed 21 (8%) and assisted in an additional 204 operations (78%). Perioperative morbidity and mortality statistics in addition to overall survival outcomes were comparable to the published literature.Conclusions:A significant proportion of major surgical operations performed within a gynaecological oncology centre require gastrointestinal procedures. The majority of these procedures can be performed by gynaecological oncologists with an acceptable perioperative morbidity and mortality rate. Subspecialty training has the potential to allow trainees significant exposure to these procedures. An accredited post-Fellowship Training Programme can provide the opportunity for hands-on experience to allow gynaecological oncologists the confidence and credibility to perform these procedures independently."

        "Abstract": "Objective:To determine whether the presence of bowel obstruction at the time of initial presentation has any prognostic significance in these women.Design:Retrospective cohort study.Setting:Dedicated gynaecological oncology service of a large tertiary institution.Population:Women who had a bowel obstruction as part of their initial presentation of ovarian cancer were identified between 1995 and 2007. Each woman was matched with four control women (with disease but no obstruction).Methods:Women with disease were compared with controls to determine the impact, if any, of bowel obstruction at presentation. Several prognostic variables including bowel obstruction were also evaluated in a Cox proportional hazard model.Main outcome measures:Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).Results:Forty-eight women with disease and 192 controls were identified during the study period. The median follow-up period was 19 months among women with disease versus 20 months in controls. No differences were seen in demographics and clinical characteristics of the women. Optimal cytoreduction rate was similar between the two groups (75% versus 78%, P = 0.7). Patients with bowel obstruction had a shorter PFS and OS compared with controls [19 months versus 21 months (P = 0.01) and 22 versus 35 months (P = 0.008)], respectively. Bowel obstruction at presentation was an independent prognostic variable with a hazard ratio of 1.5 (P = 0.009). Other prognostic variables were age, stage and extent of surgical cytoreduction.Conclusions:Bowel obstruction at the time of initial presentation is an adverse prognostic factor in women with ovarian cancer."

All women had administered a 25-microg vaginal estradiol tablet daily for 14 days prior to the operation.Primary outcome:preoperative cervical dilatation at hysteroscopy.Secondary outcomes:difference in dilatation at recruitment and before hysteroscopy, number of women who achieved a preoperative cervical dilatation of 5 mm or more, acceptability, complications and adverse effects.Results:The mean cervical dilatation was 5.7 mm (SD, 1.6 mm) in the misoprostol group and 4.7 mm (SD, 1.5 mm) in the placebo group, the mean difference in cervical dilatation being 1.0 mm (95% CI, 0.2-1.7 mm). Self-administered vaginal misoprostol of 1000 microg at home on the evening before day-care hysteroscopy is safe and highly acceptable, although a small proportion of women experienced lower abdominal pain.Conclusions:One thousand micrograms of self-administered vaginal misoprostol, 12 hours prior to day-care hysteroscopy, after 14 days of pretreatment with vaginal estradiol, has a significant cervical ripening effect compared with placebo in postmenopausal women."

A bifurcated polypropylene mesh was used to suspend the uterus from the sacral promontory. The two arms of the mesh were introduced through bilateral windows created in the broad ligaments, and were sutured to the anterior cervix; the mesh was then fixed to the anterior longitudinal ligament over the sacral promontory, to elevate the uterus.Main outcome measures:Cure of the uterine prolapse was evaluated subjectively using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire for vaginal symptoms (ICIQ-VS), and objectively by vaginal examination using the Baden-Walker halfway system and the pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q) scale. Operative and postoperative complications were also assessed.Results:The mean age of the 51 women was 52.5 years (range 19-71 years). All were sexually active, and at least three of them expressed a strong desire to have children in the future. All were available for follow-up in clinic at 10 weeks, and 38 have completed the questionnaires. In 50 out of 51 women the procedure was successful, with no objective evidence of uterine prolapse on examination at follow-up; there was one failure. Significant subjective improvements in prolapse symptoms, sexual wellbeing and related quality of life were observed, as detected by substantial reductions in the respective questionnaire scores.Conclusions:Laparoscopic hysteropexy is both a feasible and an effective procedure for correcting uterine prolapse without recourse to hysterectomy. It allows restoration of the length of the vagina without compromising its calibre, and is therefore likely to have a favourable functional outcome."

Receiver operating characteristics analysis and calibration were used to assess the accuracy of the model.Main outcome measure:The development of a clinical prediction rule for GDM. We also evaluated the potential of the prediction rule to improve the efficiency of GDM screening.Results:The probability of the development of GDM could be predicted from the ethnicity, family history, history of GDM and body mass index. The model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.77 (95% CI 0.69-0.85) and calibration was good (Hosmer and Lemeshow test statistic, P = 0.25). If an oral glucose tolerance test was performed in all women with a predicted probability of 2% or more, 43% of all women would be tested and 75% of the women with GDM would be identified.Conclusions:The use of a clinical prediction model is an accurate method to identify women at increased risk for GDM, and could be used to select women for additional testing for GDM."

Our objective was to examine neutrophil Toll-like receptor (TLR), cryopyrin, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) subunit and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and inflammatory cytokine profiles in women with pre-eclampsia or normotensive IUGR, as well as in normal pregnancy and non-pregnancy controls.Design and method:A case-control study was performed. We examined the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expressions of TLR4 and TLR2, mRNA levels of cryopyrin, IL-1beta, NF-kappaB subunits p50 and p65, as well as maternal serum inflammatory cytokine profiles (IL-2, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha], interferon-gamma [IFN-gamma] and IL-10) in women with and without pre-eclampsia using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions, flow cytometry and multiplex immunoassays.Setting:A single tertiary maternity hospital in Vancouver, Canada.Population:Women with early-onset pre-eclampsia (<34 weeks of gestation, n = 25), women with late-onset pre-eclampsia (>or=34(+0) weeks of gestation, n = 25), women with normotensive IUGR (n = 25), women with normal pregnancy (n = 75) and non-pregnancy (n = 25) controls.Results:Women with pre-eclampsia (as a single combined group of early- and late-onset, and particularly in women with early-onset pre-eclampsia) had increased TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA and protein expressions elevated cryopyrin, NF-kappaB subunit, and IL-1beta mRNA expression, and TNF-alpha:IL-10 and IL-6:IL-10 ratios compared with other groups.Conclusions:These data suggest that TLRs and cryopyrin may modulate the innate immune response of the maternal syndrome of pre-eclampsia, and might also trigger the differential inflammatory response existing between early onset pre-eclampsia and normotensive IUGR."

        "Abstract": "Eukaryotic flagella and cilia have a remarkably uniform internal 'engine' known as the '9+2' axoneme. With few exceptions, the function of cilia and flagella is to beat rhythmically and set up relative motion between themselves and the liquid that surrounds them. The molecular basis of axonemal movement is understood in considerable detail, with the exception of the mechanism that provides its rhythmical or oscillatory quality. Some kind of repetitive 'switching' event is assumed to occur; there are several proposals regarding the nature of the 'switch' and how it might operate. Herein I first summarise all the factors known to influence the rate of the oscillation (the beating frequency). Many of these factors exert their effect through modulating the mean sliding velocity between the nine doublet microtubules of the axoneme, this velocity being the determinant of bend growth rate and bend propagation rate. Then I explain six proposed mechanisms for flagellar oscillation and review the evidence on which they are based. Finally, I attempt to derive an economical synthesis, drawing for preference on experimental research that has been minimally disruptive of the intricate structure of the axoneme. The 'provisional synthesis' is that flagellar oscillation emerges from an effect of passive sliding direction on the dynein arms. Sliding in one direction facilitates force-generating cycles and dynein-to-dynein synchronisation along a doublet; sliding in the other direction is inhibitory. The direction of the initial passive sliding normally oscillates because it is controlled hydrodynamically through the alternating direction of the propulsive thrust. However, in the absence of such regulation, there can be a perpetual, mechanical self-triggering through a reversal of sliding direction due to the recoil of elastic structures that deform as a response to the prior active sliding. This provisional synthesis may be a useful basis for further examination of the problem."

        "Abstract": "Coevolutionary studies on plants and plant-feeding insects have significantly improved our understanding of the role of niche shifts in the generation of new species. Evolving plant lineages essentially constitute moving islands and archipelagoes in resource space, and host shifts by insects are usually preceded by colonizations of novel resources. Critical to hypotheses concerning ecological speciation is what happens immediately before and after colonization attempts: if an available plant is too similar to the current host(s), it simply will be incorporated into the existing diet, but if it is too different, it will not be colonized in the first place. It thus seems that the probability of speciation is maximized when alternative hosts are at an 'intermediate' distance in resource space. In this review, I wish to highlight the possibility that resource similarity and, thus, the definition of 'intermediate', are subjective concepts that depend on the herbivore lineage's tolerance to dietary variation. This subjectivity of similarity means that changes in tolerance can either decrease or increase speciation probabilities depending on the distribution of plants in resource space: insect lineages with narrow tolerances are likely to speciate by 'island-hopping' on young, species-rich plant groups, whereas more generalized lineages could speciate by shifting among resource archipelagoes formed by higher plant taxa. Repeated and convergent origins of traits known to broaden or to restrict host-plant use in multiple different insect groups provide opportunities for studying how tolerance and resource heterogeneity may interact to determine speciation rates."

        "Abstract": "Previous attempts to resolve plesiosaurian phylogeny are reviewed and a new phylogenetic data set of 66 taxa (67% of ingroup taxa examined directly) and 178 characters (eight new) is presented. We recover two key novel results: a monophyletic Plesiosauridae comprising Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus, Hydrorion brachypterygius, Microcleidus homalospondylus, Occitanosaurus tournemirensis and Seeleyosaurus guilelmiimperatoris; and five plesiosaurian taxa recovered outside the split between Plesiosauroidea and Pliosauroidea. These taxa are Attenborosaurus conybeari, 'Plesiosaurus'macrocephalus and a clade comprising Archaeonectrus rostratus, Macroplata tenuiceps and BMNH 49202. Based on this result, a new name, Neoplesiosauria, is erected for the clade comprising Plesiosauroidea and Pliosauroidea. Taxon subsamples of the new dataset are used to simulate previous investigations of global plesiosaurian relationships. Based on these simulations, most major differences between previous global phylogenetic hypotheses can be attributed to differences in taxon sampling. These include the position of Leptocleididae and Polycotylidae and the monophyly or paraphyly of Rhomaleosauridae. On this basis we favour the results recovered by our, larger analysis. Leptocleididae and Polycotylidae are sister taxa, forming a monophyletic clade within Plesiosauroidea, indicating that the large-headed, short-necked 'pliosauromorph' body plan evolved twice within Plesiosauria. Rhomaleosauridae forms the monophyletic sister taxon of Pliosauridae within Pliosauroidea. Problems are identified with previous phylogenetic definitions of plesiosaurian clades and new, stem-based definitions are presented that should maintain their integrity over a range of phylogenetic hypotheses. New, rank-free clade names Cryptoclidia and Leptocleidia are erected to replace the superfamilies Cryptoclidoidea and Leptocleidoidea. These were problematic as they were nested within the superfamily Plesiosauroidea. The incongruence length difference test indicates no significant difference in levels of homoplasy between cranial and postcranial characters."

Its origins begin peripubertally, as adolescent HA commonly leads to adult HA and decreased fertility. HA reduces inhibition of gonadotropin releasing hormone pulse frequency by progesterone, causing rapid LH pulse secretion and further increasing ovarian androgen production. Obese girls are at risk for HA and develop increased LH pulse frequency with elevated mean LH by late puberty. Many girls with HA do not exhibit normal LH pulse sensitivity to progesterone inhibition. Thus, HA may adversely affect LH pulse regulation during pubertal maturation leading to persistent HA."

Size and histological features of cysts removed.Results:A total of 155 cases were identified. There were 62 ovarian cysts in children under nine who were prepubertal. There were 58 neoplastic cysts in total. Most were benign teratomas (36). Ten cysts were malignant, including five granulosa cell tumours, one yolk sac tumour, one endodermal sinus tumour and one dysgerminoma. Tumour markers were performed in only 16 cases (10%). Sixty-one (39%) had an ultrasound scan and 16 (10%) had a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Ninety girls (58%) had an oophorectomy and 40 (25%) had an ovarian cystectomy. Oophorectomies were performed for all cases of malignancy, but 75 were also performed for benign or normal pathology. Only 16% of cases were referred to the paediatric gynaecologist and all were for post-operative management.Conclusions:We recommend the greater use of imaging of the pelvis and tumour markers preoperatively. There should be greater use of conservative expectant management or ovarian-sparing surgery in view of the low risk of malignancy in this age group. The practice of removing ovaries for benign cysts may be overcome by appointing more gynaecologists with advanced training skills training in paediatric and adolescent gynaecology."

        "Abstract": "Uterine agenesis is one of the differential diagnoses in adolescent girls with delayed menstruation. It may also be suspected earlier in childhood during investigations for other genitourinary conditions. However, accurate confirmation that the uterus is absent can be extremely difficult before puberty because of its small size. We describe ten girls referred to a specialist centre with a presumed diagnosis of an absent uterus which was later found to be incorrect. We conclude that imaging should be undertaken by clinicians with experience in management of this age group and in some girls it may be necessary to delay final diagnosis until after puberty."

        "Abstract": "In genetic family studies, ages at onset of diseases are routinely collected. Often one is interested in assessing the familial association of ages at the onset of a certain disease type. However, when a competing risk is present and is related to the disease of interest, the usual measure of association by treating the competing event as an independent censoring event is biased. We propose a bivariate model that incorporates two types of association: one is between the first event time of paired members, and the other is between the failure types given the first event time. We consider flexible measures for both types of association, and estimate the corresponding association parameters by adopting the two-stage estimation of Shih and Louis (1995, Biometrics 51, 1384-1399) and Nan et al. (2006, Journal of the American Statistical Association 101, 65-77). The proposed method is illustrated using the kinship data from the Washington Ashkenazi Study."

However, most existing methods result in considerable negative bias in applications, where field surveys typically represent only a small fraction of sampled communities. This article develops a new method based on sampling with replacement to estimate species richness via the generalized jackknife procedure. The proposed estimator yields small bias and reasonably accurate interval estimation even with small samples. The performance of the proposed estimator is compared with several typical estimators via simulation study using two complete census datasets from Panama and Malaysia."

        "Abstract": "The nested case-control design is a relatively new type of observational study whereby a case-control approach is employed within an established cohort. In this design, we observe cases and controls longitudinally by sampling all cases whenever they occur but controls at certain time points. Controls can be obtained at time points randomly scheduled or prefixed for operational convenience. This design with longitudinal observations is efficient in terms of cost and duration, especially when the disease is rare and the assessment of exposure levels is difficult. In our design, we propose sequential sampling methods and study both (group) sequential testing and estimation methods so that the study can be stopped as soon as the stopping rule is satisfied. To make such a longitudinal sampling more efficient in terms of both numbers of subjects and replications, we propose applying sequential sampling methods to subjects and replications, simultaneously, until the information criterion is fulfilled. This simultaneous sequential sampling on subjects and replicates is more flexible for practitioners designing their sampling schemes, and is different from the classical approaches used in longitudinal studies. We newly define the σ-field to accommodate our proposed sampling scheme, which contains mixtures of independent and correlated observations, and prove the asymptotic optimality of sequential estimation based on the martingale theories. We also prove that the independent increment structure is retained so that the group sequential method is applicable. Finally, we present results by employing sequential estimation and group sequential testing on both simulated data and real data on children's diarrhea."

Multiple events case-control (MECC) studies provide a new approach to sampling from a cohort and are useful when it is desired to study multiple types of events in the cohort. In this design, subjects in the cohort who develop any event of interest are sampled, as well as a fraction of the remaining subjects. We show that a simple case-control analysis of data arising from MECC studies is biased and develop three general estimating-equation-based approaches to analyzing data from these studies. We conduct simulation studies to compare the efficiency of the various MECC analyses with each other and with the corresponding conventional analyses. It is shown that the gain in efficiency by using the new design is substantial in many situations. We demonstrate the application of our approach to a nested case-control study of the effect of oral sodium phosphate use on chronic kidney injury with multiple case definitions."

Estimation is quick and diagnostics are available, meaning a variety of candidate models can be compared. The method is illustrated using simulation and the anticoagulation application."

A woman's choice of birth site may be affected by her provider's opinion and practice site. The objectives of this study were to describe American nurse-midwives' attitudes toward, and experiences with, planned home birth, and to explore correlates and predictors of their attitudes toward planned home birth as measured by the Provider Attitudes towards Planned Home Birth (PAPHB) scale.Methods:A survey instrument, which incorporates the PAPHB and assesses demographic, education, practice, personal experience, and external barrier variables that may predict attitudes toward planned home birth practice, was completed by 1,893 nurse-midwives. Bivariate analysis identified associations between variables and attitudes. Linear regression modeling identified predictors of attitudes.Results:Variables that significantly predicted favorable attitudes to planned home birth were increased clinical and educational experiences with planned home birth (p < 0.001), increased exposure to planned home birth (p < 0.001), and younger age (p < 0.001). External barriers that significantly predicted less favorable attitudes included financial (p = 0.03) and time (p < 0.001) constraints, inability to access medical consultation (p < 0.001), and fear of peer censure (p < 0.001). Willingness to practice in the home was correlated with factors related to nurse-midwives' confidence in their management abilities and beliefs about planned home birth safety.Conclusions:The results suggest that nurse-midwives' choice of practice site and comfort with planned home birth are strongly influenced by the nature and amount of exposure to home birth during professional education or practice experiences, in addition to interprofessional, logistic, and environmental factors. Findings from this research may inform interdisciplinary education and collaborative practice in the area of planned home birth."

We studied the effect of genital tract trauma, labor care, and birth variables on the incidence of pain in a population of healthy women exposed to low rates of episiotomy and operative vaginal delivery.Methods:A prospective study of genital trauma at birth and assessment of postpartum perineal pain and analgesic use was conducted in 565 midwifery patients. Perineal pain was assessed using the present pain intensity (PPI) and visual analog scale (VAS) components of the validated short-form McGill pain scale. Multivariate logistic regression examined which patient characteristics or labor care measures were significant determinants of perineal pain and use of analgesic medicines.Results:At hospital discharge, women with major trauma reported higher VAS pain scores (2.16 +/- 1.61 vs 1.48 +/- 1.40; p < 0.001) and were more likely to use analgesic medicines (76.3 vs 23.7%, p = 0.002) than women with minor or no trauma. By 3 months, average VAS scores were low in each group and not significantly different. Perineal pain at the time of discharge was associated in univariate analysis with higher education level, ethnicity (non-Hispanic white), nulliparity, and longer length of active maternal pushing efforts. In a multivariate model, only trauma group and length of active pushing predicted the pain at hospital discharge. In women with minor or no trauma, only length of the active part of second stage labor had a positive relationship with pain. In women with major trauma, the length of active second stage labor had no independent effect on the level of pain at discharge beyond its effect on the incidence of major trauma.Conclusions:Women with spontaneous perineal trauma reported very low rates of postpartum perineal pain. Women with major trauma reported increased perineal pain compared with women who had no or minor trauma; however, by 3 months postpartum this difference was no longer present. In women with minor or no perineal trauma, a longer period of active pushing was associated with increased perineal pain."

The objective of this study was to evaluate how an education program for expectant fathers who attended their partners' labor and birth affected their anxiety.Methods:In a randomized controlled trial, 87 expectant fathers who attended their pregnant partners through labor and birth at a hospital in central Taiwan were allocated by block randomization to an experimental (n = 45) and a control (n = 42) group. The men completed their basic personal information, a childbirth expectations questionnaire, and a Trait Anxiety Inventory when they were recruited. Two hours after birth of their child, all the expectant fathers completed a State of Anxiety Inventory.Results:Our results showed no statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups of fathers in trait anxiety and their prenatal childbirth expectations. After analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was applied to correct for education level, sources of childbirth information, attendance at Lamaze childbirth classes, and childbirth expectations at baseline, the effect of the childbirth program was significant for the postnatal level of anxiety (F = 3.38, p = 0.001).Conclusions:The study findings justify the clinical implementation of a birth education program based on the self-efficacy theory as an effective means of reducing anxiety among expectant fathers."

The voices of women have largely been ignored in this debate. The purpose of this study is to report on the experiences of 559 women who had a planned home birth over a 2-year period in British Columbia, Canada.Methods:We asked all women in the Province of British Columbia who had planned for their birth to be at home with a regulated midwife in attendance to answer an open-ended question about positive and negative aspects of their birth. The qualitative method of interpretive description was used to understand what women believed to be the essence of their experience.Results:Women felt strongly positive about their trust in their midwife's skill and knowledge, a sense of emotional support and empowerment attained through their relationship with the midwife, perceptions of relaxation in their own home, being informed and included in the planning of their care, and the amount of time the midwife spent with their family. They believed that the confidence arising from their intense preparation and partnership with their midwives permitted them to choreograph their birth experience to a degree that would not be possible in a formal setting.Conclusions:Women who planned a home birth with a registered midwife in British Columbia were overwhelmingly positive about their experience. Our qualitative report underscores the value women place on having the choice to give birth at home."

The present paper reports on how the literature has portrayed fatherhood over the past 20 years. The aim was to investigate men's psychological transition to fatherhood from pregnancy of the partner through the infant's first year of life.Methods:The PsycINFO, PubMed, MEDLINE, Ingenta, Ovid, EMBASE, and WoS databases were accessed to conduct a literature search on the topic. The concepts of self-image transformation, triadic relationship development, and social environment influence were used to examine the complexity of the fatherhood transition process. Specific focus was placed on men's intrapsychic relational and social dimensions.Results:Our analysis of the yielded results revealed three specific fatherhood stages: prenatal, labor and birth, and postnatal periods. Partner pregnancy was found to be the most demanding period in terms of psychological reorganization of the self. Labor and birth were the most intensely emotional moments, and the postnatal period was most influenced by environmental factors. The latter was also experienced as being the most interpersonally and intrapersonally challenging in terms of coping with the new reality of being a father.Conclusions:Men's transition to fatherhood is guided by the social context in which they live and work and by personal characteristics in interplay with the quality of the partner relationship. Men struggle to reconcile their personal and work-related needs with those of their new families."

Messages about what characteristics are normal (or expected) in childbirth are disseminated in a variety of ways, including popular childbirth education books, but little study of them has been conducted. The purpose of this investigation is to address that gap by examining the discussions about childbirth in the 10 top-selling books in the United States.Methods:Discourse analysis (relating to the public, personal, and political discussions about a specific phenomenon) was used to study 10 best-selling United States childbirth advice books marketed to childbearing women during the first week of November 2007.Results:Book styles ranged from clinical descriptions of pregnancy and birth primarily offering reassurance, self-help information, and danger signs to more folksy and humorous commentaries. Presentation of scientific evidence to support recommendations was uneven and at times inaccurate. Five focal areas of discourse included body image, labor and birth, pain, power and control, and life preparation for motherhood.Conclusions:Top-selling books shine an interesting light on the current state of United States maternity practices. Women and health professionals should assess them carefully and engage with each other about their recommendations and implications for childbirth."

After Katrina, obstetric, prenatal, and neonatal care was compromised in the short term, but increases in adverse birth outcomes such as preterm birth, low birthweight, and maternal complications were mostly limited to highly exposed women. Both pregnant and postpartum women had rates of post-traumatic stress disorder similar to, or lower than, others exposed to Katrina, and rates of depression similar to other pregnant and postpartum populations. Health behaviors, such as smoking and breastfeeding, may have been somewhat negatively affected by the disaster, whereas effects on nutrition were likely associated with limited time, money, and food choices, and indicated by both weight gain and loss. We conclude that, with a few specific exceptions, postdisaster concerns and health outcomes for pregnant and postpartum women were similar to those of other people exposed to Hurricane Katrina. In such situations, disaster planners and researchers should focus on providing care and support for the normal concerns of the peripartum period, such as breastfeeding, depression, and smoking cessation. Contraception needs to be available for those who do not want to become pregnant. Although additional physical and mental health care needs to be provided for the most severely exposed women and their babies, many women are capable of surviving and thriving in postdisaster environments."

        "Abstract": "In places where hospital birth is the norm, one of the major contemporary challenges to the organization of intrapartum care is posed by women who are not in established labor. In the United Kingdom, these women have been given a special name, \"Category X,\" and they can account for a substantial percentage of admissions (1). These women are not deemed to be in need of hospital care, but the women themselves may feel otherwise as they struggle to understand the sensations they are experiencing. Until relatively recently, little research effort was expended on early and latent phase labor, reflecting, perhaps, the assumption that it is just a gentle and relatively straightforward preamble to the \"real thing\" that can easily be dealt with by keeping mobile, leaning over furniture, or doing the ironing. Because early labor is not seen as needing a health professional's input, the message is that it is unimportant. However, emerging evidence is challenging that view. Four large randomized controlled trials have recently evaluated interventions related to early labor care (2-5), stimulated by concerns that included repeated visits to the labor ward and the impact of early admission with the potential for a cascade of interventions. These trials, and other research reporting women's own perspectives on labor onset, reflect growing awareness that this stage of labor merits consideration in its own right. An International Early Labor Research Group has formed who will develop the evidence base in this important part of childbearing. The group represents varied disciplines including midwifery, psychology, epidemiology, antenatal education, and service user representatives. Members of this group are among those who have contributed to this Roundtable Discussion. The contributions draw attention to the complexities of early labor and its importance for childbearing women, their caregivers and companions. We might reasonably hypothesize that a woman's experience of early labor sets the scene for what follows, and it is clear that this is an area worthy of considerable further research."

        "Abstract": "Oxytocin is the drug most commonly associated with preventable adverse perinatal outcomes. In 2007 it was added to the Institute for Safe Medication Practices short list of medications \"bearing a heightened risk of harm,\" which may \"require special safeguards to reduce the risk of error.\" In January 2009 the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology published a Clinical Opinion paper about oxytocin's inclusion on the list and how the obstetrics profession in the United States should respond. The authors call for the development of specific evidence-based guidelines to reduce the likelihood of patient harm by limiting elective use of oxytocin, decreasing the need for indicated use, reducing dosages during necessary use, giving more responsibility and authority for the patient's safety to the professional who is \"at the bedside administering and monitoring the oxytocin infusion\" (i.e., the nurse), and accepting that \"more time rather than more oxytocin is generally preferable\" once adequate uterine activity has been achieved. It is unfortunate that this important paper discounted the risk of harm from cesarean sections and did not mention the strong linkage between epidural analgesia and use of oxytocin. Physicians, midwives, nurses, and others should examine and discuss these issues further in view of increased alertness to the risk of harm from unsafe use of oxytocin."

        "Abstract": "There is limited knowledge about the exact role of the pelvic floor in male sexual functioning. Pelvic floor muscle function might be involved in the enhancement of blood flow to the penis, and evidence suggests an active role for the ischio- and bulbocavernous muscles and other pelvic floor muscles in the initiation and maintenance of erection. Increased activity of pelvic floor muscles might also be preparatory to ejaculation. Studies have shown positive results after physical therapy for erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation and chronic pelvic pain syndrome. However, the methodological quality of some of these studies is poor and further research validating specific physical therapies in the assessment and treatment of male sexual function is necessary. In this respect physical therapists have a potential role as integral members of healthcare teams involved in the improvement of male sexual health."

In 2006, the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI) was mailed to surviving male participants. Logistic regression was used to examine associations of baseline hormone concentrations with AUA-SI.Results:Among 158 surviving men with complete data and no history of prostate cancer, the mean (sd) age at serum sex steroid assessment was 58 (6.6) years with a mean (sd) follow-up of 20.3 (0.6) years. In age-adjusted logistic regression, there was a significant inverse association of testosterone : dihydrotestosterone (DHT) with LUTS (P = 0.05). Also, men with higher concentrations of bioavailable testosterone had a 56% decreased risk of LUTS compared with those with hypogonadal concentrations, although the association was not statistically significant (odds ratios 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.14-1.40) or distributed evenly among quartiles. There were no significant associations of total testosterone, oestradiol (E(2)), testosterone : E(2), DHT, or dehydroepiandrosterone with LUTS or with any measured hormones and urinary bother.Conclusions:In this cohort, men with higher mid-life levels of testosterone : DHT and bioavailable testosterone had a decreased 20-year risk of LUTS. These data support other studies reporting inverse associations of serum testosterone with LUTS. Clinical trials of testosterone therapy should include LUTS and clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia as outcomes."

Patients were initially managed conservatively with bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG). Uni- and multivariate analyses compared the predictive value of age, gender, hospital, carcinoma in situ (CIS), tumour-size, reviewed grade and reviewed stage.Results:With a mean follow-up of 6.4 years, there was disease progression in 48 (29%) patients and 26 (16%) died from BC. Associated CIS was found in 55 (34%) patients. After reviewing the slides, 24 (15%) tumours were downstaged to pTa, 134 (82%) remained pT1 and six (4%) were upstaged to > or =pT2. The grade review resulted in 74 G2, 90 G3, 37 low-grade and 127 high-grade lesions for the two systems used. In multivariate analyses, reviewed stage (both P < 0.001) and CIS (P = 0.017 and 0.023) had independent significance for progression and disease-specific survival, respectively.Conclusion:A stage review is indicated in pT1 BC, as almost 20% of pT1 tumours were up- or downstaged, and the reviewed stage predicted the patient's prognosis. Hence, pathology review identified patients with different prognoses who might benefit from other treatment strategies than BCG. We confirmed that CIS is an unfavourable sign in pT1 bladder cancer."

Animal models for HSE are used to investigate mechanisms of acute disease, but little has been done to model chronic manifestations of HSE. The current study presents a detailed, systematic analysis of chronic neuropathology, including characterization of topography and sequential progression of degenerative lesions and inflammation. Subsequent to intranasal HSV-1 infection, inflammatory responses that were temporally and spatially distinct persisted in infected cortical and brain stem regions. Neutrophils were present exclusively within the olfactory bulb and brain stem regions during the acute phase of infection, while the chronic inflammation was marked by plasma cells, lymphocytes and activated microglia. The chronic lymphocytic infiltrate, cytokine production, and activated microglia were associated with the loss of cortical neuropile in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. Animals surviving the acute infection showed a spectrum of chronic lesions from decreased brain volume, neuronal loss, activated astrocytes, and glial scar formation to severe atrophy and cavitations of the cortex. These lesions were also associated with severe spatial memory deficits in surviving animals. Taken together, this model can be utilized to further investigate the mechanisms of neurological defects that follow in the wake of HSE."

        "Abstract": "Although the 2008 World Health Organization classification defines two subtypes of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), classical and aggressive, we often encounter MCL with both features in the same site. We named this feature \"MCL with focal aggressive form (intermediate MCL)\". In the present study, we reclassified 237 patients with cyclin D1 (CCND1)-positive MCL on the basis of the concept of intermediate MCL, and analyzed the correlation of this reclassification with immunohistochemical detection of CCND1, Ki-67, p53, p27(Kip1), and p21(WAF/Cip1). The median overall survival was 77, 31, and 18 months for classical, intermediate, and aggressive MCL, respectively, showing a statistically significant difference (P < 0.0001). The expression levels of CCND1, Ki-67, p53, and p21(WAF/Cip1) in aggressive MCL (mean 80.1 +/- 27.8%, 73.7 +/- 28.9%, 31.0 +/- 69.0%, and 10.4 +/- 24.8%, respectively) were higher than those in classical MCL (mean 58.1 +/- 36.7%, 25.2 +/- 25.5%, 6.5 +/- 24.3%, and 2.5 +/- 13.0%, respectively) and intermediate MCL (mean 75.7 +/- 31.4%, 30.8 +/- 33.3%, 21.0 +/- 57.4%, and 4.8 +/- 16.5%, respectively). Significantly different levels of Ki-67 and p21(WAF/Cip1) were only recognized between intermediate and aggressive (P < 0.05 and P < 0.0001, respectively), whereas those of CCND1 and p53 were only between classical and intermediate (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.05, respectively). There were no significant differences in p27(Kip1) among the three groups. The subsequent discriminant analysis with independent prognostic factors clearly demonstrated that the morphological evolution of MCL occurs in parallel with increased labeling index of CCND1 and Ki-67. The diagnosis of intermediate MCL thus proved to be of major significance and should enable the design of more tailored therapies."

A new mode of administration through the intact skin [epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT)], using an original epicutaneous delivery system, may represent an alternative to these classical methods.Objective:Proof of concept of efficacy of EPIT on intact skin in mice sensitized to aeroallergens or food allergens.Methods:Mice were sensitized to pollen (n=18), house dust mite (HDM, n=24), ovalbumin (OVA, n=18) or peanut (n=18), and allocated to four groups: EPIT, SCIT, not treated (NT) and control. Specific Ig (sIg)E, sIgG1 and sIgG2a were monitored. After 8 weeks of treatment, plethysmography was performed after aerosol provocation with appropriate allergens.Results:At the highest doses of methacholine, pause enhancement (Penh) values were significantly decreased in the EPIT group vs. the sensitized NT groups (7.5 vs. 12.3 - pollen, 7.6 vs. 8.9 - HDM, 11.5 vs. 14.5 - OVA, 7.6 vs. 12.8 - peanut, respectively) (P<0.05). With all the allergens tested, Penh values were similar in SCIT, EPIT and control. IgG2a for pollen, HDM, OVA and peanuts were significantly increased in the EPIT group vs. NT: 0.97 vs. 0.42 microg/mL, 2.5 vs. 0.46 microg/mL, 0.39 vs. 0.05 microg/mL and 15.0 vs. 5.5 microg/mL, respectively (P<0.05). There were no significant differences between EPIT and SCIT groups. The IgE/IgG2a ratio decreased significantly in the EPIT group for the four allergens from 70 to 58 (pollen), 175 to 26 (HDM), 5433 to 120 (OVA) and 49 to 6 (peanut), respectively (P<0.05).Conclusion:In mice sensitized to the four allergens tested, EPIT was as efficacious as SCIT, considered as the reference immunotherapy. These first results have to be confirmed by clinical studies."

        "Abstract": "Activation of complement occurs during autoimmune retinal and intraocular inflammatory disease as well as neuroretinal degenerative disorders. The cleavage of C5 into fragments C5a and C5b is a critical event during the complement cascade. C5a is a potent proinflammatory anaphylatoxin capable of inducing cell migration, adhesion and cytokine release, while membrane attack complex C5b-9 causes cell lysis. Therapeutic approaches to prevent complement-induced inflammation include the use of blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to prevent C5 cleavage. In these current experiments, the rat anti-mouse C5 mAb (BB5.1) was utilized to investigate the effects of inhibition of C5 cleavage on disease progression and severity in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU), a model of organ-specific autoimmunity in the eye characterized by structural retinal damage mediated by infiltrating macrophages. Systemic treatment with BB5.1 results in significantly reduced disease scores compared with control groups, while local administration results in an earlier resolution of disease. In vitro, contemporaneous C5a and interferon-gamma signalling enhanced nitric oxide production, accompanied by down-regulation of the inhibitory myeloid CD200 receptor, contributing to cell activation. These experiments demonstrate that C5 cleavage contributes to the full expression of EAU, and that selective C5 blockade via systemic and local routes of administration can suppress disease. This presents great therapeutic potential to protect against tissue damage during autoimmune responses in the retina or inflammation-induced degenerative disease."

Flk-1(+) MSCs are a population of MSCs with defined phenotype and their safety has been evaluated in Phase 1 clinical trials. We designed this study to evaluate whether Flk-1(+) MSCs conferred a therapeutic effect on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), an animal model of rheumatic arthritis, and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Flk-1(+) MSCs, 1-2 x 10(6), were injected into CIA mice on either day 0 or day 21. The clinical course of arthritis was monitored. Serum cytokine profile was determined by cytometric bead array kit or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Flk-1(+) MSCs and splenocytes co-culture was conducted to explore the underlying mechanisms. Flk-1(+) MSCs did not confer therapeutic benefits. Clinical symptom scores and histological evaluation suggested aggravation of arthritis in mice treated with MSCs at day 21. Serum cytokine profile analysis showed marked interleukin (IL)-6 secretion immediately after MSC administration. Results of in vitro culture of splenocytes confirmed that the addition of Flk-1(+) MSCs promoted splenocyte proliferation and increased IL-6 and IL-17 secretion. Moreover, splenocyte proliferation was also enhanced in mice treated with MSCs at day 21. Accordingly, MSCs at low concentrations were found to promote lipopolysaccharide-primed splenocytes proliferation in an in vitro co-culture system. We propose that Flk-1(+) MSCs aggravate arthritis in CIA model by at least up-regulating secretion of IL-6, which favours Th17 differentiation. When Flk-1(+) MSCs are used for patients, we should be cautious about subjects with rheumatoid arthritis."

We evaluated different respiratory mucosa immunization protocols that included the nasal administration of Lactococcus lactis-pneumococcal protective protein A (PppA) live, inactivated, and in association with a probiotic (Lc) to young mice. The animals that received Lc by the oral and nasal route presented the highest levels of immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgG anti-PppA antibodies in bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) and IgG in serum, which no doubt contributed to the protection against infection. However, only the groups that received the live and inactivated vaccine associated with the oral administration of the probiotic were able to prevent lung colonization by S. pneumoniae serotypes 3 and 14 in a respiratory infection model. This would be related to a preferential stimulation of the T helper type 1 (Th1) cells at local and systemic levels and with a moderate Th2 and Th17 response, shown by the cytokine profile induced in BAL and by the results of the IgG1/IgG2a ratio at local and systemic levels. Nasal immunization with the inactivated recombinant strain associated with oral Lc administration was able to stimulate the specific cellular and humoral immune response and afford protection against the challenge with the two S. pneumoniae serotypes. The results obtained show the probiotic-inactivated vaccine association as a valuable alternative for application to human health, especially in at-risk populations, and are the first report of a safe and effective immunization strategy using an inactivated recombinant strain."

In the patient presented here, the NPC2 exon 4 frameshift mutation c.408_409delAA caused reduced NPC2 protein levels in serum and lung lavage fluid and the synthesis of an aberrant, larger sized protein of around 28 kDa. Protein expression was strongly reduced also in alveolar macrophages. The infant developed failure to thrive and tachypnea. Lung lavage, computer tomography, and histology showed typical signs of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis with an abnormal intraalveolar accumulation of surfactant as well as macrophages. An NPC2-hypomorph animal model also showed pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and accumulation of macrophages in the lung, liver, and spleen long before the mice died. Due to the elevation of cholesterol, the surfactant had an abnormal composition and function. Despite the removal of large amounts of surfactant from the lungs by therapeutic lung lavages, this treatment was only temporarily successful and the infant died of respiratory failure. Our data indicate that respiratory distress in NPC2 disease is associated with a loss of normal NPC2 protein expression in alveolar macrophages and the accumulation of functionally inactive surfactant rich in cholesterol."

        "Abstract": "Cabezas syndrome (MIM 300354) is a recently identified syndromic form of X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) caused by mutations in the CUL4B gene. In total, nine XLMR families carrying mutations in the CUL4B gene have been described to date. Here, we present a detailed clinical phenotype of three affected brothers of Polish descent. Based on the symptoms, we made a clinical diagnosis of Cabezas syndrome, which was subsequently confirmed by identification of a novel nonsense mutation (c.2107A-->T, p.703K-->X) in exon 18 of the CUL4B gene. The mutation was inherited from an asymptomatic mother and was present in all three affected brothers. The patients presented with typical features of Cabezas syndrome, such as severe mental retardation, speech impairment, hyperactivity, seizures, intention tremor, inguinal hernia, small feet, and craniofacial dysmorphism. In addition to previously described symptoms, syndactyly of the second and third toes and skin manifestations (hyperhydrosis and keratosis pilaris) were present in our cases. Our report provides further support that Cabezas syndrome is a recognizable syndromic form of XLMR. We conclude that the CUL4B gene should be screened in males with severe speech impairment and primary intention tremor, especially if characteristic facial dysmorphism is also present."

        "Abstract": "Women who carry BRCA mutations are advised to begin breast cancer screening based on the age-specific risks of breast cancer development. It is not clear to what extent the family history of breast cancer influences age of onset. We evaluated the use of family history to predict the age of breast cancer onset in BRCA mutation carriers. Pedigrees from an Ontario-based registry were reviewed to identify the index case of breast cancer (most recent diagnosis) and other family cases of breast cancer. The youngest age of breast cancer diagnosis and mean age at breast cancer diagnosis in the other family cases were compared to the age of onset in the index case. The 260 BRCA1 and 213 BRCA2 pedigrees were reviewed. In BRCA2 families, the index case was diagnosed on average at 44.4 years when the youngest reported family case was less than or equal to 35 years, compared to 51.9 years when the earliest cases were diagnosed after age 50 (p = 0.04). A modest trend was seen for BRCA1 carriers, but this was not statistically significant. To a small extent, the onset of breast cancer in a BRCA2 mutation carrier can be predicted from her family history of cancer, however, the trend is modest and should not alter clinical recommendations regarding initiation of screening."

Since this duplication was not present in 1577 Belgian persons, we consider this as an extremely rare variant which has the potential to provide further insight into the genetics of autism. The duplication contains seven genes including the DISC1 gene, an interesting candidate gene that has been associated to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism and Asperger syndrome. In this report we describe additional analyses undertaken to investigate the causal relationship of the duplication to the autism phenotype. We conclude that the 1q42.2 microduplication probably confers susceptibility to autism in the current family. This study is a typical illustration of the difficult interpretation of causality of a very rare variant in neuropsychiatric disease and the challenge of genetic counselling in a particular family."

Trichothiodystrophy (TTD) is a rare (affected frequency of 10(-6)) recessive disorder caused by mutations in genes involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway and in transcription. Based on our novel clinical observations, we conducted a genetic epidemiologic study to investigate gestational outcomes associated with TTD. We compared pregnancies resulting in TTD-affected offspring (n = 24) with respect to abnormalities during their antenatal and neonatal periods to pregnancies resulting in their unaffected siblings (n = 18), accounting for correlation, and to population reference values. Significantly higher incidence of several severe gestational complications was noted in TTD-affected pregnancies. Small for gestational age (SGA) <10th percentile [Relative risk (RR ) = 9.3, 95% CI = 1.4-60.5, p = 0.02], SGA <3rd percentile (RR = 7.2, 95% CI = 1.1-48.1, p = 0.04), and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) hospitalization (RR = 6.4, 95% CI = 1.4-29.5, p = 0.02) occurred more frequently among TTD-affected neonates compared with their unaffected siblings. Compared with reference values from general obstetrical population, pregnancies that resulted in TTD-affected infants were significantly more likely to be complicated by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome (RR = 35.7, 95% CI = 7.6-92.5, p = 0.0002), elevated mid-trimester maternal serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels (RR = 14.3, 95% CI = 7.0-16.6, p < 0.0001), SGA <3rd percentile (RR = 13.9, 95% CI = 7.4-21.1, p < 0.0001), pre-term delivery (<32 weeks) (RR = 12.0, 95% CI = 4.9-21.6, p < 0.0001), pre-eclampsia (RR = 4.0, 95% CI = 1.6-7.4, p = 0.006), and decreased fetal movement (RR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.6-5.2, p = 0.0018). Abnormal placental development is an underlying mechanism that may explain the constellation of observed complications in our study. Thus, we hypothesize that TTD DNA repair and transcription genes play an important role in normal human placental development."

The role of copy number variation is well established in the pathogenesis of rare genomic disorders. More recently, germline and somatic copy number variation have been shown to be important pathogenic factors in a range of common diseases, including infectious, autoimmune and neuropsychiatric diseases and cancer. In this review, we describe the range of methods available for measuring copy number variants (CNVs) in individuals and populations, including the limitations of presently available assays, and highlight some key examples of common diseases in which CNVs have been shown clearly to have a pathogenic role. Although there has been major progress in this field in the last 5 years, understanding the full contribution of CNVs to the genetic basis of common diseases will require further studies, with more accurate CNV assays and larger cohorts than have presently been completed."

Differences in rating of morally relevant issues between groups of professionals have not yet been described. A modified Delphi study in two rounds was held to identify differences between groups of experts (i.e. clinicians, representatives of patient organisations, ethicists and persons with a commercial background). The strongest correlation was found between the opinions of ethicists and representatives of patient organisations (0.67) and between clinicians and ethicists (0.62). Moderate correlation (0.55) was found between the opinions of clinicians and representatives of patient organisations. Persons with a commercial background showed a weak correlation with clinicians (0.41), ethicists (0.35) and representatives of patient organisations (0.30). These differences in rating of morally relevant issues between various professional groups are relevant for clinical practice and dementia care, particularly the different rating of prenatal diagnosis found between clinicians and representatives of patient organisations. Interdisciplinary consultations between various professional groups -including at least researchers, clinicians and ethicists -are recommended to guarantee that all considerations will be incorporated into the debate on ethical issues of genetic research into AD."

Another four mutations have been found, and previously reported, in our patients: p.H113D, p.P172L, p.Y243del and p.Y369Q. Eleven patients presented seven known mutations: p.R127Q, p.I166I, p.A198T, p.R263G, p.R302C, p.R378C and c.1142_1145dup. The latter three were found in more than one unrelated patient: p.R302C was detected in a heterozygous girl and a mosaic male, p.R378C in two males and finally, c.1142_1145dup in three females; only one in 20 mothers was found to be a carrier (p.R263G). Apart from those 20 patients, the only alteration detected in one girl with clear PDHc and PDH-E1 deficiency was the silent change c.396A> C (p.R132R), and other eight PDHc deficient patients carry combinations of known infrequent polymorphisms that are overrepresented among our 20 unsolved patients. The importance of these changes on PDH activity is unclear. Investigations in the other PDHc genes are in course in order to elucidate the genetic defect in the unresolved patients."

Machined (MS) and acid-etched surfaces (ES) were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope, energy dispersing spectroscopy (EDS), contact angle analysis and human marrow stromal cells' culture.Results:Significant differences were observed in the topography and wetability of the tested surfaces. However, etched surfaces presented a high level of wetability when compared with machined surfaces. Contact angles showed considerable differences between etched and machined surfaces (Friedman test P<0.05). EDS analysis showed the same composition on both the surfaces tested. Counting of adhered cells on both types of surfaces showed that there is no statistical significance in human marrow stromal cells' adhesion after 18 h (Mann-Whitney test P>0.05).Conclusion:The present study concludes that modifications on the titanium implant surfaces roughness may promote differences in the morphology of bone marrow stromal cells. Nevertheless, in this microenvironment, no interference in the adhesion phenomenon was noted."

In this review, we sought to ascertain any factors that would reduce the use of these limited commodities. Seventy-five adult CLKT were performed over a 23-yr period at our center, 29 (39%) of which occurred during the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) era. Overall, patient survival rates were 82%, 73%, and 62% at one, three, and five yr, respectively. There was no difference in patient survival based either on pre-transplant hemodialysis status or by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at the time of transplant. Patients undergoing a second CLKT or a liver retransplantation at the time of CLKT had a survival rate of 30% at three months. In the MELD era, patient survival was unchanged (p = NS) despite an older recipient population (p = 0.0029) and a greater number of hepatitis C patients (p = 0.0428). In summary, patients requiring liver retransplantation with concomitant renal failure should be denied CLKT. Renal allografts may also be spared by implementing strict criteria for renal organ allocation (GFR < 30 mL/min at the time of evaluation) and considering the elimination of preemptive kidney transplantation in CLKT."

Four conversions were excluded for the outcome analysis. The operation time of HLDN group (188 ± 62 min) was shorter, although not significantly, than that of TLDN group's (207 ± 30 min) (p = 0.065). However, the operation time of the first 24 cases (237 ± 66 min) was significantly longer than that of the later 69 performed (180 ± 35 min). The warm ischemia time was shorter in HLDN (2.5 ± 1.3 min) compared to that of TLDN (4.1 ± 1.7 min) (p < 0.01), but the serum creatinine values (mg/dL) of recipients were equivalent (HLDN/TLDN = 1.18 ± 0.3:1.14 ± 0.3, p = 0.587). There was no difference in the length of hospital stay (6.7 vs. 6.4 d, p = 0.475). There was no graft loss, but one ureter stricture (HLDN group) and one urinary leakage (TLDN group) were recorded.Conclusions:Both HLDN and TLDN are effective and safe as reflected in graft functions and limited complications. There was a learning curve in establishing the technique of laparoscopic donor nephrectomy."

During the first six wk and over the whole first year post-transplant, the use of sirolimus was associated with lower levels of hepatocyte proliferation compared to sirolimus-free patients, (overall, 0.3 [0-7.2] vs. 3 [0-49] KI-67 positive hepatocytes per high power field, p ≤ 0.05). The levels observed in the sirolimus group were similar to those seen in non-transplanted control patients with normal parenchyma (0.2 [0-1.3], p = NS). Post-transplant hepatocyte proliferation correlated with the serum levels of sirolimus (p ≤ 0.05), but not with those of tacrolimus or with the dose of mycophenolate mofetil (p = 0.9 and 0.3, respectively).Conclusions:These data suggest that sirolimus is associated with decreased post-transplant hepatocyte proliferation. The clinical significance of this observation remains to be fully determined."

        "Abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a disease characterized by persistent and progressive deterioration of glucose tolerance. Both insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion contribute to development of Type 2 diabetes. However, whilst insulin resistance is fully apparent in the pre-diabetic condition, impairment of insulin secretion worsens over the time, being paralleled by a progressive decline in both pancreatic B-cell function and B-cell mass. Intense research has identified a number of genetic variants that may predispose to impaired B-cell function, but such predisposition can be precipitated and worsened by toxic effects of hyperglycaemia (glucotoxicity) and elevated levels of free fatty acids (lipotoxicity). All these aspects of the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes are discussed in this review. Moreover, treatments that target reduction in glucotoxicity or lipotoxicity are outlined, including emerging strategies that target the role of glucagon-like peptide 1 and sodium glucose co-transporter 2."

Diabetes in mothers and children was identified from International Classification of Diseases 10 diagnosis codes in the hospital records.Results:There were 272 children admitted to hospital with a first diagnosis of diabetes out of 502 040 live births. Incidence for the infants born in 2000 was 16.0 per 100 000 person-years. Maternal Type 1 diabetes was a significant risk factor [crude relative risk (RR) 6.33], but maternal Type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes were not significantly associated with diabetes in the child. Late preterm birth (34-36 weeks) (RR 1.64) and caesarean section (RR 1.30) increased the risk of a diabetes admission. Size-for-gestational-age was significantly associated with onset of diabetes (small-for-gestational age RR 0.48), but neither birth weight categories nor birth weight as a continuous variable were associated with risk of diabetes. Increasing maternal age was associated with an increased risk of diabetes in the child (RR 1.13 for each additional 5 years of age).Conclusions:This study identified risk factors associated with onset of Type 1 diabetes before 6 years of age, in a recent birth cohort. Size-for-gestational-age had a consistent association with risk of early onset of Type 1 diabetes, small size being protective. Size-for-gestational-age measures should be preferred to birth weight thresholds when assessing risk of diabetes."

        "Abstract": "Aims While the disposition index provides a useful measure of B-cell function, its calculation requires the performance of a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT). Recently, the demonstration of a hyperbolic relationship between indices of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity derived from the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) has led to the introduction of two novel OGTT-based measures of B-cell function analogous to the disposition index: (i) the insulin secretion-sensitivity index-2 (ISSI-2) (defined as the ratio of the area-under-the-insulin-curve to the area-under-the-glucose curve, multiplied by the Matsuda index) and (ii) insulinogenic index (IGI)/fasting insulin. However, neither of these two measures has been directly compared with the disposition index. Methods Two hundred and thirteen non-diabetic children (122 boys, 91 girls) underwent both OGTT and FSIVGTT, allowing for the calculation of ISSI-2, IGI/fasting insulin and the disposition index. Results ISS1-2 and IGI/fasting insulin were strongly correlated with each other (r = 0.82, P < 0.0001). Both measures correlated with the disposition index, with ISSI-2 showing a modestly stronger association (ISSI-2: r = 0.24, P = 0.0003; IGI/fasting insulin: r = 0.21, P = 0.0022). Standardized linear regression analyses confirmed that the relationship between log ISSI-2 and the disposition index (standardized regression coefficient = 0.224, P = 0.001) was stronger than that between log IGI/fasting insulin and the disposition index (standardized regression coefficient = 0.166, P = 0.015). Conclusions The OGTT-derived measures ISSI-2 and IGI/fasting insulin exhibit modest correlations with the disposition index. These relationships require further assessment in other patient populations."

Using screening data from the Nateglinide And Valsartan in Impaired Glucose Tolerance Outcomes Research (NAVIGATOR) study (n = 42 149), we examined whether alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a biomarker for NAFLD, clustered with features of MetS and whether the clusters differed across global geographic regions.Methods:Exploratory factor analysis using principle components analysis was applied to data drawn from the NAVIGATOR screening population (n = 41 111). Demographic data, anthropomorphic measurements and blood pressure (BP) collected during the screening visit, as well as blood samples analysed for ALT, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and fasting and 2-h glucose measures after an oral glucose tolerance test were used for our analysis.Results:Two factors, interpreted as lipid (Factor 1), and BP/obesity (Factor 2) were identified, explaining approximately 50% of the variance in the overall population. Similar patterns of aggregation were reproducible across all geographic regions except Asia, where fasting glucose loaded more consistently on Factor 1. ALT loaded with mean arterial pressure, fasting glucose and waist circumference except in Asia, where it loaded only with mean arterial pressure and waist circumference.Conclusions:ALT aggregated with components of MetS, and the pattern of aggregation of ALT with other features of MetS was similar across regions except Asia, possibly indicating a different pathophysiology for NAFLD in Asia. Predictive models of NAFLD may need to be adjusted for regional and ethnic differences."

The cohort was re-investigated in 2006-2008. Of those individuals without diabetes (baseline), 887 (74%) participated in the follow-up.Results:Ninety-three (10.5%) developed diabetes during the 7-year follow-up period {standardized incidence rates [95% confidence interval (CI)] per 1000 person-years: total 15.5; 12.6, 19.1; men 20.2; 15.6, 26.1; women 11.3; 7.9, 16.1}. In both sexes, those who developed diabetes were slightly older, were more obese, had a more adverse metabolic profile (higher glucose values, HbA(1c), fasting insulin, uric acid, and triglycerides) and were more likely to have hypertension at baseline than were participants remaining free of diabetes (P < 0.05). On stepwise logistic regression, age, parental diabetes, body mass index, uric acid, current smoking, HbA(1c) and fasting and 2-h glucose (OGTT) were strong predictors of diabetes incidence. The risk of diabetes was higher in subjects with isolated impaired glucose tolerance (odds ratio 8.8; 95% CI 5.0, 15.6) than in isolated impaired fasting glucose (4.7; 2.2, 10.0), although the difference did not reach statistical significance.Conclusions:For the first time, we have estimated the incidence of Type 2 diabetes in an elderly German cohort and demonstrated that it is among the highest in Europe. The OGTT appears to be useful in identifying individuals with high Type 2 diabetes risk. Our results support a role of smoking in the progression to diabetes."

All participants underwent standardized 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs), along with fasting capillary plasma glucose (FCG) tests in 2006. One urban community underwent OGTTs directly in 2002 (n = 1815), while a two-step screening strategy using FCG as a first-line screening test followed by OGTTs was used in 9039 individuals in 2001. Diabetes and pre-diabetes was defined according to the 2006 World Health Organization/International Diabetes Federation criteria.Results:Based on the results of direct OGTTs, the age-standardized prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in urban areas was 12.2 and 15.4% in 2002, whereas the prevalences were 18.8 and 28.7% in urban areas and 14.1 and 20.2% in rural areas in 2006 (P < 0.001, in urban areas). Using the two-step screening strategy, the prevalence of diabetes in 2001 was 10.1% in urban and 7.7% in rural areas and 13.8% in urban and 12.2% in rural areas in 2006 (P < 0.001). Based on the data of the 2006 survey, the two-step screening strategy missed 30.2% of diabetes cases when compared with the number defined by the direct OGTT approach.Conclusions:Qingdao has experienced a marked increase in the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in the past 5 years. Intervention to prevent a further increase in the prevalence of diabetes is urgently required."

Thus, we investigated the associations of serum NGF level and NGF receptor activity with the presence and severity of DPN.Methods:One hundred and thirty-six patients with Type 2 diabetes were included in this cross-sectional study. Serum NGF levels were measured by ELISA. Expressions of NGF receptors (TrkA and p75(NTR)) were measured by immunohistochemical staining. The presence and severity of DPN were assessed by neuropathy disability score (NDS) and by corneal nerve fibre length (cNFL) and nerve branch density (cNBD) using in vivo confocal microscopy.Results:Patients with DPN had higher serum NGF levels (56-451 pg/ml) than patients without DPN (4-54 pg/ml). However, in DPN patients, serum NGF was negatively associated with neuropathy severity (mild 222 +/- 64 pg/ml; moderate 114 +/- 17 pg/ml; severe 89 +/- 20 pg/ml). This negative association was consistent in all severity indices (NDS, P < 0.001; cNFL, P < 0.001; cNBD P = 0.010) even after adjustment for age, sex, diabetes duration, insulin use, fasting glucose and glycated haemoglobin. Although NGF receptor activities had significantly (P < 0.05) negative associations with the presence and severity of neuropathy, these associations were not significant when adjusted for other factors.Conclusions:Serum NGF level was positively associated with the presence of DPN but negatively associated with neuropathy severity in DPN patients. The change in serum NGF might be a consequence of, rather than a contributor to, the early development of DPN."

Patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus were recruited as a comparison group.Patients:with abnormal ALT were investigated for underlying causes. Prevalence of abnormal ALT was analysed at three separate cut-offs and multivariable analysis used to identify independent risk factors.Results:Nine hundred and eleven with Type 1 diabetes and 963 with Type 2 diabetes were included. The prevalence of elevated ALT was dependent on the cut-off value: > 30 IU/l in males and > 19 IU/l in females, > 50 and > 63 IU/l was 34.5, 4.3 and 1.9%, respectively, in Type 1 diabetes and 51.4, 8.2 and 3.7%, respectively, in Type 2 diabetes. In Type 1 diabetes an elevated ALT was associated with worse glycaemic control, age > 55 years and elevated triglycerides. Investigation of these patients revealed a cause in 43.6% of patients, predominantly non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Conclusions:Elevated ALT is not uncommon in Type 1 diabetes and is associated with NAFLD-related risk factors. Patients with Type 1 diabetes and elevated ALT should be investigated as significant abnormalities may be found which are amenable to interventions."

In a post-hoc analysis, we categorized patients not receiving insulin at baseline and treated by oral monotherapy into two main cohorts: add-on to metformin alone (n = 514) and sulphonylurea alone (n = 1001). The follow-up averaged 34.5 months.Results:There were significantly greater reductions in glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) with pioglitazone than with placebo and more pioglitazone-treated patients achieved HbA(1c) targets, irrespective of the baseline oral glucose-lowering regimen and despite a decrease in the use of other glucose-lowering agents. Approximately twice as many in the placebo groups progressed to permanent insulin use than in the pioglitazone groups across the two cohorts: 3.4% for pioglitazone and 6.5% for placebo when added to metformin monotherapy and 6.3% and 14.8%, respectively, when added to sulphonylurea monotherapy. The overall safety of both dual therapies was good.Conclusions:Intensifying an existing oral monotherapy regimen to a dual oral regimen by adding pioglitazone resulted in sustained improvements in glycaemic control and reduced progression to insulin therapy.

The number and type of hypoglycaemic episodes and glycaemic control were assessed before, during and after Ramadan. Bivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors which predicted hypoglycaemia during Ramadan.Results:Only one episode of severe hypoglycaemia occurred in each time period before, during and after Ramadan. Mild hypoglycaemic episodes increased from 156 pre-Ramadan to 346 during Ramadan (P < 0.001) and decreased to 153 post-Ramadan (P = 0.0002).The increase during Ramadan was mainly attributed to increased symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes. FBG and glycated haemoglobin improved during the titration period and did not change during the rest of the study. Risk of hypoglycaemic events during Ramadan was higher in countries where fasting is strict [odds ratio (OR) 3.69 (2.06-6.63), P < 0.0001]. Lower weight [< 70.0 kg; OR 2.56 (1.46-4.48), P = 0.001] and waist circumference [< 90 cm; OR 3.06 (1.62-5.78), P = 0.001] increased the risk of hypoglycaemia during Ramadan whilst FBG > 6.7 mmol/l [OR 0.3 (0.17-0.54), P < 0.0001] had a protective effect.Conclusions:Combination of insulin glargine and glimepiride may be used during Ramadan in patients with Type 2 diabetes who wish to fast, provided glimepiride is given at the time of breaking the fast and insulin glargine titrated to provide FBG > 6.7 mmol/l."

        "Abstract": "Aim:To determine the performance of glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) as a screening tool for detecting newly diagnosed diabetes (NDM) and pre-diabetes.Methods:A diabetes survey was conducted in Beijing among community dwellers who were willing to participate in the survey. Included in the survey were 903 individuals aged 21-79 years without previously diagnosed diabetes and in whom HbA(1c) and other required covariates had been measured. NDM and pre-diabetes (impaired glucose tolerance + impaired fasting glucose) were defined according to the World Health Organization 1999 criteria based on 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was plotted to determine the performance of HbA(1c).Results:The prevalence of NDM and pre-diabetes was 11.1% and 22.4%, respectively. At an optimal HbA(1c) cut-off point of > or = 6.0%, the test gave a sensitivity of 80.0% and a specificity of 89.8% for diagnosing NDM; at an optimal cut-off point of > or = 5.7%, the sensitivity was 59.4% and specificity 73.9% for diagnosing pre-diabetes. Individuals with HbA(1c)> or = 6.0% tended to be more obese than those with HbA(1c) < 6.0%, but blood pressure and lipid profiles did not differ between the two groups.Conclusions:HbA(1c) as a single screening test is adequate to detect newly diagnosed diabetes but is not able to identify pre-diabetes in this obese Chinese population."

Quality measures examined were recording of glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)), blood pressure (BP), cholesterol and smoking status in the last 12 months; achievement of recommended intermediate outcome targets (HbA(1c)< or = 7.4%, BP < 140/80 mmHg, cholesterol < or = 5.0 mmol/l, not smoking); and simple and all-or-none composite measures.Results:Ninety-five per cent of all recommended processes were received by patients, with 88% of patients receiving all four. Half of all intermediate outcomes targets were achieved, but only 16% of patients achieved all four targets. Process and outcome of care were consistently worse for 1523 (15.0%) patients aged < 55 years. HbA(1c) and BP targets were progressively less likely to be achieved as body mass index increased. Women were less likely to achieve cholesterol targets, but apart from smoking status, there were no associations with socio-economic status.Conclusion:Under comprehensive pay-for-performance, process of care is remarkably reliable, but intermediate outcome control less so. Previously identified socio-economic variations in diabetes care have been largely eliminated, but gender inequality is persistent. Younger people were considerably less likely to achieve intermediate outcome targets. Mitigating increased vascular risk in younger patients with Type 2 diabetes presents major challenges for health services in the face of the evolving epidemics of obesity and diabetes."

Primary outcome was all hospital admissions and emergency visits; secondary outcomes were the composite of first cardiac event or death and readmission for diabetes complications. Cox-proportional hazards regression was used to analyse Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes separately.Results:The empowerment programme significantly delayed time to first hospital admission/visit for patients with Type 2 diabetes; the hazard ratio (HR) of 0.41 (P = 0.01) translates into a delay of almost 3 years; this was partly driven by a significant reduction in cardiovascular events and mortality (HR = 0.24, P = 0.01). These effects were not seen for people with Type 1 diabetes.Conclusions:A one-time, advanced diabetes education programme teaching intensive insulin self-management with an empowerment style can lead to sustained improvement in patient outcomes and reduce use of hospital services for people with Type 2 diabetes on insulin."

The interactive effects of coping styles and psychological stress on depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed by hierarchical multiple regression analyses.Results:There were significant associations of the four domains of psychological stress with anxiety and depressive symptoms, except for the relationship between 'reduced economic condition' and depressive symptoms. 'Negative coping style' significantly increased the level of both anxiety and depressive symptoms; whereas, 'active coping style' and 'avoidant coping style' decreased the risk of depressive symptoms. The interactions of 'negative coping style' with 'worrying about decline in body/physical function' and 'reduced economic condition' significantly increased the risk of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and the interaction of 'social/family crisis caused by the disease' with 'avoidance coping style' and 'worrying about decline in body/physical function' with 'active coping style' significantly decreased the risk of depressive symptoms.Conclusions:The results of this study suggest that certain coping styles might moderate the association of psychological stress with anxiety and depressive symptoms in Chinese patients with Type 2 diabetes."

This brief report examines quality of care among diabetic patients attending a tertiary retinal clinic.Methods:A cross-sectional survey, notes review, and slit-lamp examination was conducted in 139 diabetic patients attending a specialist retinal clinic to assess the quality of comprehensive diabetes care. DR was graded according to the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study scale.Results:The prevalence of non-proliferative DR (NPDR) and proliferative DR (PDR) was 39.6 and 35.2%, respectively. The prevalence of microalbuminuria in patients with no DR, NPDR and PDR was 32, 54.1 and 68.8%, respectively. Glycaemic control was suboptimal (mean HbA(1c) 8.0 +/- 1.8%) and 15.8% were current smokers. Drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system were used by only 61.9% of patients with both DR and microalbuminuria, and aspirin by only 35.3%.Conclusions:These data suggest that diabetes care in this high-risk population with established microvascular complications was suboptimal. Specialist clinics dealing with diabetic complications may be a setting where quality improvement strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality should be focused."

The survey focused on all the essential elements for retinal screening, including assessment and treatment of screen-positive cases. Eighty-five per cent of screening programmes have a coordinated screening service and 73% of these felt that they have made significant progress. Eighty-five per cent of screening units use 'call and recall' for appointments and 73.5% of programmes follow the National Screening Committee (NSC) guidance. Although many units worked closely with ophthalmology, further assessment and management of screen-positive patients was a cause for concern. The fast-track referral system, to ensure timely and appropriate care, has been difficult to engineer by several programmes. This is demonstrated by 48% of programmes having waiting lists for patients identified as needing further assessment and treatment for retinopathy. Ophthalmology service for people with diabetic retinopathy was provided by a dedicated ophthalmologist in 89.4% of the programmes. Sixty-six per cent of the programmes reported inadequate resources to sustain a high-quality service, while 26% highlighted the lack of infrastructure and 49% lacked information technology (IT) support. In conclusion, progress has been made towards establishing a national screening programme for diabetic retinopathy by individual screening units, with a number of programmes providing a structured retinal screening service. However, programmes face difficulties with resource allocation and compliance with Quality Assurance (QA) standards, especially those which apply to ophthalmology and IT support. Screening programmes need to be resourced adequately to ensure comprehensive coverage and compliance with QA."

We performed a meta-analysis of 117 field or experimental-garden studies that measured pair-wise trait differences of a total of 125 invasive and 196 non-invasive plant species in the invasive range of the invasive species. We tested whether invasiveness is associated with performance-related traits (physiology, leaf-area allocation, shoot allocation, growth rate, size and fitness), and whether such associations depend on type of study and on biogeographical or biological factors. Overall, invasive species had significantly higher values than non-invasive species for all six trait categories. More trait differences were significant for invasive vs. native comparisons than for invasive vs. non-invasive alien comparisons. Moreover, for comparisons between invasive species and native species that themselves are invasive elsewhere, no trait differences were significant. Differences in physiology and growth rate were larger in tropical regions than in temperate regions. Trait differences did not depend on whether the invasive alien species originates from Europe, nor did they depend on the test environment. We conclude that invasive alien species had higher values for those traits related to performance than non-invasive species. This suggests that it might become possible to predict future plant invasions from species traits."

However, the exact mechanism by which NAP1-like proteins act is currently unknown. In this work, we characterized the biochemical properties of two human NAP1-like proteins, hNAP1L1 and hNAP1L4, including a previously uncharacterized subtype, with the aim of determining their exact mechanistic role. Both hNAP1L1 and hNAP1L4 were found to be localized mainly to the cytoplasm and a minor population of them was suggested to be in the nucleus. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that both hNAP1L1 and hNAP1L4 mediated nucleosome formation. In addition, hNAP1L1 was shown to possess a significantly greater nucleosome disassembly activity than hNAP1L4, suggesting that hNAP1L1 and hNAP1L4 may play distinct roles in the regulation of histone dynamics. Building upon this initial discovery we also found that histone H2A-H2B and various histone H2A variants-H2B dimers were found to associate with both hNAP1L1 and hNAP1L4 in cell extracts. These results suggest that human NAP1-like proteins play overlapping roles in transport and deposition of histone H2A-H2B or H2A variants-H2B dimers on chromatin and nonoverlapping roles in nucleosome disassembly."

Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE of brown adipose tissue (BAT) from PPARalpha-null mice produced a higher-density spot. Proteomic analysis indicated that the protein was pyruvate dehydrogenase beta (PDHbeta). To observe PDHbeta regulation in BAT, the organ was stimulated by long-term cold exposure, and the activities of associated enzymes were investigated. Histological and biochemical analyses of BAT showed a significant decrease in the triglyceride content in wild-type mice and some degree of decrease in PPARalpha-null mice on cold exposure. Analyses of molecules related to glucose metabolism showed that the expression of PDHbeta is under PPARalpha-specific regulation, and that glucose degradation ability may decrease on cold exposure. In contrast, analyses of molecules related to fatty acid metabolism showed that numerous PPARalpha/gamma target molecules are induced on cold exposure, and that fatty acid degradation ability in wild-type mice is markedly enhanced and also increases to same degree in PPARalpha-null mice on cold exposure. Thus, this study proposes novel and multiple roles of PPARalpha in BAT."

The induction of GPX1 expression in response to glucose starvation and Ca(2+) was dependent on the transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4 and cis-acting elements [stress response element (STRE)] in the GPX1 promoter. The Ras/cAMP pathway is also involved in the expression of GPX1. We found that Snf1, a Ser/Thr protein kinase, is involved in the glucose starvation- and Ca(2+)-induced expression of GPX1. The activation of Snf1 is accompanied by phosphorylation of Thr(210). We found that the Ca(2+)-treatment as well as glucose starvation causes the phosphorylation of Thr(210) of Snf1 in a Tos3, Sak1, and Elm1 protein kinase-dependent manner. As the timing of the initiation of Ca(2+)-induced expression of GPX1 was retarded in an snf1Delta mutant, the activation of Snf1 seems pivotal to the early-stage-response of GPX1 to Ca(2+)."

        "Abstract": "Using a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis origin mapping technique and cell synchronization, we have studied replication timing and mapped origins in a 75-kb region of chromosome 2 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Three of the five mapped origins are moderately active and the other two are very weak. DNA fragments containing the three moderately active origins and one weak origin are ARS-positive whereas that containing the other weak origin is ARS-negative. Three ARS elements reported earlier from this region appear to be inactive as chromosomal origins. The centromere-proximal 45 kb of this region replicates earlier than the telomere-proximal 30 kb. A transition from early to late replication occurs within 10 kb of the chromosomally inactive ars727, suggesting a possible role of the previously reported late-replication-enforcing region in determining chromosomal replication timing of the region. These results in conjunction with those from some other studies suggest that, in S. pombe, the actual number of potential origins may be significantly higher than previously detected in many genome-wide studies, and the relationship between ARS activity and chromosomal origin activity is not as simple as in Saccharomyces cerevisiae."

Clearance of creatinine (CC) was calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Four stages of RI were defined: mild (60-90 mL/min), moderate (30-60), severe (15-30) and end stage (<15). Logistic regression models were used to investigate factors associated with RI.Results:The male/female ratio of the 2588 patients enrolled was 3:1 and the median age was 42 years. At the time of assessment of CC, the median CD4 count was 430 cells/microL and HIV plasma viral load (VL) was<50 copies/mL in 60%. The overall prevalence of RI was 39.0%: 34.2% mild, 4.4% moderate, 0.3% severe and 0.2% end-stage. Mild RI was associated with female gender [odds ratio (OR)=3.3: 95% CI 2.6-4.3)], age >50 years (OR=9.8: 7.4-13.0) and 40-50 years (OR=1.9: 1.5-2.4), body mass index (BMI) <22 kg/m(2) (OR=3.3: 2.7-4.3) and tenofovir exposure (OR=1.4: 1.0-1.9 for <1 year and OR=1.5: 1.2-2.0 for >1 year). Advanced RI (CC <60 mL/min) was associated with age >50 years (OR=5.6: 2.9-10.9) and 40-50 years (OR=2.2: 1.1-1.4), BMI <22 kg/m(2) (OR=1.5: 1.0-2.4), hypertension (OR=2.5: 1.4-2.5) and indinavir (IDV) exposure >1 year (OR=2.3: 1.5-3.6).Conclusion:This survey confirms the high prevalence of RI in HIV-infected patients and indicates the importance of the investigation of renal function especially in women, older patients, those with a low BMI or treated with tenofovir or IDV."

Regimens included fluconazole 400 mg/day+AmB (AmB+Fluc400) or fluconazole 800 mg/day+AmB (AmB+Fluc800) (14 days followed by fluconazole alone at the randomized dose for 56 days); or AmB alone for 14 days followed by fluconazole 400 mg/day for 56 days. Serum (at 24 h after dosing) and CSF samples were taken at baseline and days 14 and 70 (serum only) for fluconazole measurement, using gas-liquid chromatography.Results:Sixty-four treated patients had fluconazole measurements: 11 in the AmB group, 12 in the AmB+Fluc400 group and 41 in the AmB+Fluc800 group. Day 14 serum concentration geometric means were 24.7 mg/L for AmB+Fluc400 and 37.0 mg/L for AmB+Fluc800. Correspondingly, CSF concentration geometric means were 25.1 mg/L and 32.7 mg/L. Day 14 Serum and CSF concentrations were highly correlated with AmB+Fluc800 (P<0.001, r=0.873) and AmB+Fluc400 (P=0.005, r=0.943). Increased serum area under the curve (AUC) appears to be associated with decreased mortality at day 70 (P=0.061, odds ratio=2.19) as well as with increased study composite endpoint success at days 42 and 70 (P=0.081, odds ratio=2.25 and 0.058, 2.89, respectively).Conclusion:High fluconazole dosage (800 mg/day) for the treatment of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis was associated with high serum and CSF fluconazole concentration. Overall, high serum and CSF concentration appear to be associated with increased survival and primary composite endpoint success."

While understanding the factors that dispose people towards risky behaviours is important scientifically, it can be difficult to distil the many predictors of sexual risk behaviours into a useful clinical tool for focused prevention efforts. Our goal was to evaluate the extent to which known predictors of sexual TRBs (self-efficacy, treatment optimism, engagement with medical care, awareness of risky behaviours, substance use, and relevant behavioural and socio-demographic characteristics) combined with additional attitude-related assessments to identify those who had engaged in recent sexual TRBs and may therefore be at risk of additional TRBs.Methods:In this study, we analysed data on beliefs and behaviours related to sex, substance use, HIV prevention and other relevant factors for 280 patients at a publicly funded HIV/AIDS clinic in Seattle. All participants completed a baseline audio computer-assisted self interview (ACASI) as part of a larger trial focused on reducing TRBs.Results:Our multivariate model yielded three screening questions that could prove effective in identifying HIV-positive patients in need of focused prevention resources.Conclusions:The resulting screener holds promise as a brief and easily deployed tool that can be used by providers regardless of access to ACASI technology. Additional validation is needed and longitudinal evaluation is currently in progress."

Mean duration from renal transplantation to the onset of PTLD was 7.1 years (range, 5 months to 18 years, 9 months). Mean duration of observation was 3.9 years from the onset of PTLD. Immunosuppressant therapy comprised multidrug combination therapy, including cyclosporine in six patients and tacrolimus in four patients. In addition to a reduction in the immunosuppressant dose, which was performed in all patients, PTLD was treated with surgery in seven patients, radiotherapy in two patients, rituximab in five patients, and cytotoxic chemotherapy in four patients. A complete remission in eight patients and progressive disease in two were observed. At last follow up, seven patients were alive and five patients had functioning grafts.Conclusions:The incidence of PTLD following renal transplantation at our institution is 1.6% with onset occurring more than 5 years after transplantation in five patients. Consequently, with long-term renal graft survival now feasible, attention must be paid to detecting late-onset PTLD."

As part of a translational effort, this group visit intervention was replicated in a delivery system in Seattle, Washington, and the log of total healthcare costs was measured in the first year of the intervention. Utilization and patient and physician satisfaction were secondary outcomes. For the cost and utilization analysis, a retrospective case-control design compared 221 case patients aged 65 and older with high outpatient usage in the previous 18 months with 1,015 control patients selected randomly from clinics not participating in the intervention. Controls were matched to cases on the number of primary care visits in the prior 18 months. Total costs were not statistically different for intervention patients and controls ($8,845 vs $10,288, P=.11), nor were there statistically significant differences in utilization, including hospital admissions and outpatient visits, but patient and provider satisfaction with the intervention was high. This translational effort did not demonstrate the cost savings of the original efficacy trials. Possible explanations for these divergent results may have to do with differences between those who participated and differences between the two delivery systems."

After additional adjustment for smoking, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, statin use, and antihypertensive treatment, a baseline CRP of 3.0 to 10.0 mg/L remained associated with risk of CHD (HR=1.87, 95% CI=1.09-3.25), although CRP did not improve the discriminative ability of a predicting model based on traditional risk factors (receiver operating characteristic curves from 0.740 to 0.749).Conclusion:CRP is an independent CHD risk marker but does not improve CHD risk prediction in community-dwelling elderly people."

The individual trials showed that admission to a GEMU has one or more favorable effects on the outcomes of interest, with two significant effects in the meta-analysis: less functional decline at discharge from the GEMU (RR=0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.77-0.99; P=.04) and a lower rate of institutionalization 1 year after discharge (RR=0.78, CI=0.66-0.92; P=.003). For the other outcomes in the meta-analysis, a GEMU did not induce significantly different outcomes than usual care.Conclusion:This meta-analysis shows a significant effect in favor of the GEMU group on functional decline at discharge and on institutionalization after 1 year. There is heterogeneity between the studies, poor quality of some randomized controlled trials, and shortage of information about CGA. Multidisciplinary CGA offered in a GEMU may add value to the care for frail older persons admitted to the hospital, but the limitations confirm the need for well-designed studies using explicit CGA and more-structured and -coherent assessment instruments such as the Minimum Data Set Resident Assessment Instrument."

The control homes received usual care.Measurements:The primary end point was the proportion of residents prescribed one or more inappropriate psychoactive medicine according to standardized protocols; falls were evaluated using routinely collected falls data mandated by the regulatory body for nursing homes in NI.Results:The proportion of residents taking inappropriate psychoactive medications at 12 months in the intervention homes (25/128, 19.5%) was much lower than in the control homes (62/124, 50.0%) (odds ratio=0.26, 95% confidence interval=0.14-0.49) after adjustment for clustering within homes. No differences were observed at 12 months in the falls rate between the intervention and control groups.Conclusion:Marked reductions in inappropriate psychoactive medication prescribing in residents resulted from pharmacist review of targeted medications, but there was no effect on falls."

Stroke severity, the occurrence of at least one medical complication, and premorbid disability explained most of the risk excess in the oldest-old.Conclusion:Stroke outcome is definitely worse in very old people, and most of the excess risk of death and disability is attributable to the higher occurrences of the most-severe clinical stroke syndromes and of medical complications in the acute phase. These represent potential targets for preventive and therapeutical strategies specifically for elderly people."

The Geriatric Depression Scale was used to identify depressive symptoms in face-to-face home visit interviews conducted in 2008, and the association between hearing handicap and depressive symptoms was assessed using logistic regression.Results:The incidence of depressive symptoms was 19.6% in the group with a hearing handicap and 8.0% in the group without a hearing handicap. When compared with the subjects without hearing handicap, subjects with a hearing handicap had a multiadjusted odds ratio of depressive symptoms of 2.45 (95% confidence interval=1.26-4.77). The association remained significant even when hearing impairment measured with pure-tone audiometry was added to the multiadjusted model.Conclusion:A hearing handicap can predict future depressive symptoms in older community-dwelling people."

        "Abstract": "Reduced function of the glutamate--nitric oxide (NO)--cGMP pathway is responsible for some cognitive alterations in rats with hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy. Hyperammonemia impairs the pathway in cerebellum by increasing neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) phosphorylation in Ser847 by calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), reducing nNOS activity, and by reducing nNOS amount in synaptic membranes, which reduces its activation following NMDA receptors activation. The reason for increased CaMKII activity in hyperammonemia remains unknown. We hypothesized that it would be as a result of increased tonic activation of NMDA receptors. The aims of this work were to assess: (i) whether tonic NMDA activation receptors is increased in cerebellum in chronic hyperammonemia in vivo; and (ii) whether this tonic activation is responsible for increased CaMKII activity and reduced activity of nNOS and of the glutamate--NO--cGMP pathway. Blocking NMDA receptors with MK-801 increases cGMP and NO metabolites in cerebellum in vivo and in slices from hyperammonemic rats. This is because of reduced phosphorylation and activity of CaMKII, leading to normalization of nNOS phosphorylation and activity. MK-801 also increases nNOS in synaptic membranes and reduces it in cytosol. This indicates that hyperammonemia increases tonic activation of NMDA receptors leading to reduced activity of nNOS and of the glutamate--NO--cGMP pathway."

To determine the effects of specific, purified RGS proteins on mu-opioid signaling, C6 cells stably expressing a mu-opioid receptor were rendered permeable to proteins by treatment with digitonin. Mu-opioid inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase by [D-Ala(2),N-Me-Phe(4),Gly-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO), a mu-specific opioid peptide, remained fully intact in permeabilized cells. Purified RGS domain of RGS4 added to permeabilized cells resulted in a twofold loss in DAMGO potency but had no effect in cells expressing RGS-insensitive G proteins. The inhibitory effect of DAMGO was reduced to the same extent by purified RGS4 and RGS8. In contrast, the RGS domain of RGS7 had no effect and inhibited the action of RGS8 as a result of weak physical association with Galphai2 and minimal GTPase-accelerating protein activity in C6 cell membranes. These data suggest that differences in conserved RGS domains of specific RGS proteins contribute to differential regulation of opioid signaling to adenylyl cyclase and that a permeabilized cell model is useful for studying the effects of specific RGS proteins on aspects of G protein-coupled receptor signaling."

The aim of this work was to examine if cGMP regulates the glial inflammatory response in vivo following CNS damage caused by a focal cryolesion onto the cortex in rats. Results show that treatment with the cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor zaprinast (10 mg/kg i.p.) 2 h before and 24 and 48 h after the lesion results 3 days post-lesion in notably enhanced astrogliosis manifested by increased glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity and protein levels around the lesion. In contrast, zaprinast decreased the number of round/ameboid lectin-positive cells and the expression of the activated microglia/macrophage markers Iba-1 and CD11b indicating decreased recruitment and activation of these cells. This altered inflammatory response is accompanied by a decrease in protein oxidative stress, apoptotic cell death and neuronal degeneration. In addition, zaprinast enhanced angiogenesis in the lesioned cortex probably as a result of vascular endothelial growth factor expression in reactive astrocytes. These results suggest that regulation of the glial inflammatory response may contribute to the reported neuroprotective effects of cGMP-phosphodiesterase inhibitors in brain injury."

Both parameters showed significant diurnal variations with maximal values at midnight. When hamsters were placed under constant darkness for 48 h, the differences in prostaglandin release between subjective mid-day and subjective midnight persisted. Western blot analysis showed that cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 levels were significantly higher at midnight than at mid-day, and at subjective midnight than at subjective mid-day, whereas no changes in COX-2 levels were observed among these time points. Immunohistochemical studies indicated the presence of COX-1 and COX-2 in the inner (but not outer) retina. Circadian variations of retinal prostaglandin release were also assessed in suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN)-lesioned animals. Significant differences in retinal prostaglandin release between subjective mid-day and subjective midnight were observed in SCN-lesioned animals. These results indicate that hamster retinal prostaglandin release is regulated by a retinal circadian clock independent from the SCN. Thus, the present results suggest that the prostaglandin/COX-1 system could be a retinal clock output or part of the retinal clock mechanism."

        "Abstract": "Long-term memory is formed by alterations in glutamate-dependent excitatory synaptic transmission, which is in turn regulated by synaptosomal protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25), a key component of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor complex essential for exocytosis of neurotransmitter-filled synaptic vesicles. Both reduced and excessive SNAP-25 activity has been implicated in various disease states that involve cognitive dysfunctions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Here, we over-express SNAP-25 in the adult rat dorsal hippocampus by infusion of a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector, to evaluate the consequence of late adolescent-adult dysfunction of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor protein in the absence of developmental disruption. We report a specific and significant increase in the levels of extracellular glutamate detectable by microdialysis and a reduction in paired-pulse facilitation in the hippocampus. In addition, SNAP-25 over-expression produced cognitive deficits, delaying acquisition of a spatial map in the water maze and impairing contextual fear conditioning, both tasks known to be dorsal hippocampal dependent. The high background transmission state and pre-synaptic dysfunction likely result in interference with requisite synapse selection during spatial and fear memory consolidation. Together these studies provide the first evidence that excess SNAP-25 activity, restricted to the adult period, is sufficient to mediate significant deficits in the memory formation process."

This study aimed to determine the effects of this compound on the expression of nerve terminal serotonergic markers in rats. Experiment 1 investigated MDMA-induced changes in levels of the serotonin transporter (SERT) and the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT-2) in the hippocampus, a region with sparse dopaminergic innervation, after lesioning noradrenergic input with N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4). Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered 100 mg/kg DSP-4 or saline 1 week prior to either an MDMA (10 mg/kg x 4) or saline binge. Two weeks following the binge treatment, the DSP-4/MDMA group unexpectedly showed little change in hippocampal VMAT-2 protein expression compared with DSP-4/Saline controls, despite large reductions in SERT levels in all regions examined in the MDMA-treated animals. Furthermore, animals treated with binge MDMA (Experiment 2) showed a striking decrease in SERT gene expression (and a lesser effect on VMAT-2) measured by quantitative RT-PCR in pooled dorsal and median raphe tissue punches, when compared with saline-treated controls. These results demonstrate that MDMA causes substantial regulatory changes in the expression of serotonergic markers, thus questioning the need to invoke distal axotomy as an explanation of MDMA-related serotonergic deficits."

A prospective clinical trial has shown that rasagiline confers significant symptomatic improvement and demonstrated alterations in Parkinson's disease progression. Rasagiline is primarily metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 to form its major metabolite, 1-(R)-aminoindan, a non-amphetamine, weak reversible MAO-B inhibitor compound. Recent studies indicated the potential neuroprotective effect of 1-(R)-aminoindan, suggesting that it may contribute to the overall neuroprotective and antiapoptotic effects of its parent compound, rasagiline. This review article briefly highlights the molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective properties of the active metabolite of rasagiline, 1-(R)-aminoindan, supporting the valuable potential of rasagiline for disease modification."

Neurosci. 2004, 24:10149) and a decrease in the osmolarity of the extracellular space fluid (Dmitriev et al., Vis. Neurosci. 1999, 16:1157). Here, we show the existence of an endogenous purinergic mechanism that prevents hypoosmotic swelling of retinal glial (Müller) cells in mice. In contrast to the cells from wild-type mice, hypoosmotic stress induced rapid swelling of glial cell somata in retinal slices from mice deficient in P2Y(1), adenosine A(1) receptors, or ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73). Consistently, glial cell bodies in retinal slices from wild-type mice displayed osmotic swelling when P2Y(1) or A(1) receptors, or CD73, were pharmacologically blocked. Exogenous ATP, UTP, and UDP inhibited glial swelling in retinal slices, while the swelling of isolated glial cells was prevented by ATP but not by UTP or UDP, suggesting that uracil nucleotides indirectly regulate the glial cell volume via activation of neuronal P2Y(4/6) and neuron-to-glia signaling. It is suggested that autocrine/paracrine activation of purinergic receptors and enzymes is crucially involved in the regulation of the glial cell volume."

        "Abstract": "Aggregation of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) to form oligomers is considered to be a key step in generating neurotoxicity in the Alzheimer's disease brain. Agents that bind to Abeta and inhibit oligomerization have been proposed as Alzheimer's disease therapeutics. In this study, we investigated the binding of fluorescein-labeled Abeta(1-42) (FluoAbeta(1-42)) to SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and examined the effect of the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP), on the Abeta cell interaction. FluoAbeta(1-42) bound to the cells in a punctate pattern. Surprisingly, when RAP was added to the incubations, FluoAbeta(1-42) and RAP were found to be co-localized on the cell surface, suggesting that RAP and Abeta may bind to each other. Experiments using the purified proteins confirmed that a RAP-Abeta complex was stable and resistant to sodium dodecyl sulfate. RAP also inhibited Abeta oligomerization. We next examined whether RAP could inhibit the neurotoxic effects of Abeta. Addition of Abeta(1-42) to SH-SY5Y cells caused an increase in intracellular Ca2+ that was inhibited by treatment of the Abeta peptide with RAP. RAP also blocked an Abeta-induced inhibition of long-term memory consolidation in 1-day-old chicks. This study demonstrates that RAP binds to Abeta and is an inhibitor of the neurotoxic effects of Abeta."

        "Abstract": "GABA(A) receptors are sensitive to subtle changes in the environment in both early-life and adulthood. These neurochemical responses to stress in adulthood are sex-dependent. Acute stress induces rapid changes in GABA(A) receptors in experimental animals, with the direction of the changes varying according to the sex of the animals and the stress-paradigm studied. These rapid alterations are of particular interest as they provide an example of fast neurotransmitter system plasticity that may be mediated by stress-induced increases in neurosteroids, perhaps via effects on phosphorylation and/or receptor trafficking. Interestingly, some studies have also provided evidence for long-lasting changes in GABA(A) receptors as a result of exposure to stressors in early-life. The short- and long-term stress sensitivity of the GABAergic system implicates GABA(A) receptors in the non-genetic etiology of psychiatric illnesses such as depression and schizophrenia in which stress may be an important factor."

Pharmacological modulation of A(2A)Rs is particularly useful in Parkinson's disease and has been tested in schizophrenia. However, little is known about the regulation of A(2A)R gene (ADORA2A). A bioinformatic analysis revealed the presence of three CpG islands in the 5' UTR region of human ADORA2A. Next, HeLa, SH-SY5Y and U87-MG cells were treated for 48 h with 5 muM 5-azacytidine (Aza). Increased A(2A)R levels were demonstrated in HeLa and SH-SY5Y cells when compared with non-treated cells. No modifications were seen in U87-MG cells. The increased A(2A)R mRNA and protein levels were accompanied by a loss of DNA methylation pattern in HeLa and SH-SY5Y cells, as measured with the SEQUENOM MassArray platform. The Aza treatment also reduced the affinity of a methyl-CpG-binding protein for ADORA2A by quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation in HeLa cells. Interestingly, A(2A)R levels were reduced by S-adenosyl-l-methionine treatment in U87-MG and methyl-CpG-binding protein affinity was increased for ADORA2A by quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation. Therefore, these results show for the first time that DNA methylation plays a role in ADORA2A transcription and, subsequently, in constitutive A(2A)R cell surface levels."

        "Abstract": "Among multiple structural and functional brain changes, aging is accompanied by an increase of inflammatory signaling in the nervous system as well as a dysfunction of the immune system elsewhere. Although the long-held view that aging involves neurocognitive impairment is now dismissed, aging is a major risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer;s disease, Parkinson;s disease and Huntington's disease, among others. There are many age-related changes affecting the brain, contributing both to certain declining in function and increased frailty, which could singly and collectively affect neuronal viability and vulnerability. Among those changes, both inflammatory responses in aged brains and the altered regulation of toll like receptors, which appears to be relevant for understanding susceptibility to neurodegenerative processes, are linked to pathogenic mechanisms of several diseases. Here, we review how aging and pro-inflammatory environment could modulate microglial phenotype and its reactivity and contribute to the genesis of neurodegenerative processes. Data support our idea that age-related microglial cell changes, by inducing cytotoxicity in contrast to neuroprotection, could contribute to the onset of neurodegenerative changes. This view can have important implications for the development of new therapeutic approaches."

Sequence analysis of C38 cDNA revealed that C38 is equivalent to rat BM88, which has been reported to induce cell-cycle arrest and neuronal differentiation in Neuro2a cells. C38 and Ki67, a marker of proliferating cells, were not colocalized during retinal development. C38 was first detected in the retinal ganglion cells at embryonic day 16, much later than the expression of doublecortin, a marker of immature neurons. Although all the horizontal cells were post-mitotic at this stage, C38 was not detected in horizontal cells until the postnatal period. In addition, C38 over-expression did not induce neuronal differentiation or cell-cycle arrest of pluripotent P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. Instead, C38 promoted maturation during neuronal differentiation of P19 embryonal carcinoma cells by down-regulating Oct-3, a pluripotent cell marker and enhancing the expressions of positive regulators of neurogenesis. In conclusion, during retinal development, C38 is first expressed in post-mitotic retinal neurons and is up-regulated during their maturation. C38 does not induce neuronal competence in pluripotent cells, but does promote maturation in already committed neuronal cells."

        "Abstract": "Sleep apnea (SA) can be effectively managed in humans but it is recognized that when left untreated, SA causes long-lasting changes in neuronal circuitry in the brain. Recent neuroimaging studies gave suggested that these neuronal changes are also present even in patients successfully treated for the acute effects of SA. The cellular mechanisms that account for these changes are not certain but animal models of intermittent hypoxia (IH) during sleep have shown neuronal death and impairment in learning and memory. Reactive gliosis has a drastic effect on neuronal survival and circuitry and in this study we examined the neuro-glial response in brain areas affected by SA. Glial and neuronal alterations were analyzed after 1, 3, 5 and 10 days of exposure to IH (8 h/day during the sleep phase, cycles of 6 min each, 10-21% O2) and observed significant astroglial hyperplasia and hypertrophy in parietal brain cortex and hippocampus by studying gliofibrillary acidic protein, Vimentin, S100B and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression. In addition, altered morphology, reduced dendrite branching and caspase activation were observed in the CA-1 hippocampal and cortical (layers IV-V) pyramidal neurons at short exposure times (1-3 days). Surprisingly, longer exposure to IH reduced the neuronal death rate and increased neuronal branching in the presence of persistent reactive gliosis. Up-regulation of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) and mdr-1, a HIF-1alpha target gene, were observed and increased expression of receptor for advanced end glycated products and its binding partner S100B were also noted. Our results show that a low number of hypoxic cycles induce reactive gliosis and neuronal death whereas continuous exposure to IH cycles reduced the rate of neuronal death and induced neuronal branching on surviving neurons. We hypothesize that HIF-1alpha and S100B glial factor may improve neuronal survival under hypoxic conditions and propose that the death/survival/re-growth process observed here may underlie brain circuitry changes in humans with SA."

Implant stability quotient (ISQ) values obtained using a recently introduced wireless RFA device have made it possible to evaluate stability in a non-invasive technique; however, there are few studies of the factors that affect ISQ values determined using this device. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between ISQ values determined by wireless RFA and various factors related to dental implant stability using a pig cortical bone model. Dental implants (Replace) Select Tapered implants) with a length of 10 mm were placed into pig cortical bone samples, then, ISQ values were determined using wireless RFA under various conditions (probe orientation, diameter of implant, insertion torque and peri-implant bone loss). The results of this study showed that ISQ values were not affected by the direction of the probe from parallel to perpendicular to the long axis of the pig bone or to the smart peg. In addition, the diameter of the implant did not have a significant effect on the measured ISQ values. Statistically significant correlations were found between insertion torque and ISQ values (Spearman's test, P < 0.05), and lower ISQ values were observed for deeper peri-implant vertical defects (Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.05). A wireless RFA device appears to be useful for measuring implant stability within the limits of the present in vitro study."

The patients were asked a standardized series of questions concerning dry mouth, and their whole salivary flow rates were measured. Patients with a history of radiation therapy displayed the most decreased values of salivary flow rates and the most severe associated symptoms and behaviours while patients with unknown aetiology displayed the least decreased values of salivary flow rates and relatively favourable symptoms and behaviours. A burning sensation in the mouth was the most prevalent in patients with systemic diseases or those who were taking medications while altered taste perception was the most prevalent in patients taking antipsychotics.

A retrospective analysis of 372 consecutive patients with TMD was conducted. Their panoramic radiographs were evaluated for the extent of their contribution to the final diagnosis. Panoramic radiography was of no diagnostic value in 94.4% of the cases when the group was considered as a whole. When patients diagnosed with DJD were considered separately, panoramic radiography was completely sufficient for reaching the final diagnosis in 20.0% of the cases. In almost 90% of these patients, however, the clinical examination did not support the diagnosis of DJD (no coarse crepitus was found). This raises some doubts about the effectiveness of the clinical examination according to the RDC/TMD and about the utility of panoramic radiography in the definitive diagnosis of DJD, because both techniques have low accuracy (11.1% and 20%, respectively). The present study supports the current recommendations that panoramic radiography should not be ordered routinely to assess DJD, but still it is first choice when any dental problem is suspected. Further additional imaging (computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) should be considered only if there is reason to expect that the findings might affect diagnosis and management. This study adds to recent criticisms of the clinical validity of the RDC/TMD, with regard to DJD."

Twenty-two Japanese women (aged 23.2 +/- 5.4 years) and 10 Japanese men (aged 22.4 +/- 2.8 years) exhibiting unilateral TMJ OA were included in this study. Two angular and seven linear measurements were obtained for the analysis of the skeletal hard tissues. The cephalometric measurement values (CV) were normalized using the CV ratio for the evaluation of the degree of mandibular asymmetry. The EMG was recorded during maximal voluntary clenching efforts for 10 s in the intercuspal position. The average values of integral EMG (iEMG) of three trials were normalized using the iEMG ratio for the evaluation of the functional balance of the masticatory muscles. The mandibular midline was shifted to the TMJ OA side with a median value of 9.85 mm. The CV ratio of the ramus height of the TMJ OA side was significantly smaller than that of the non-OA side. For the masseter muscle, the iEMG ratio of the TMJ OA side was significantly larger than that of the non-OA side (P < 0.05). These results suggest that unilateral TMJ OA is related to the dentofacial morphology, thus resulting in a mandibular midline shift to the affected side and it is associated with a masticatory muscle imbalance."

Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) measurements of pulpal blood flow (PBF) were taken 6 and 18 weeks after dental injury Treatment response (success or failure) was categorized based on findings of clinical and radiographical evaluation after 9 months. Forty-four (34%) subjects were categorized as treatment success (absence of loss of sensitivity, periapical radiolucency and grey discolouration of crown), 43 (33%) as treatment failures (loss of sensitivity, and periapical radiolucency and/or grey discolouration of crown) and 43 (33%) as acceptable outcome (loss of sensitivity). After using univariate analysis to determine the association between potential clinical and LDF predictor variables and treatment response status, preliminary prediction rules were developed for prediction of success [positive likelihood ratio (LR), 29.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.7-496.4] and failure (negative LR, 0.55; CI, 0.4-0.7). The most important variables were subluxation, root fracture, baseline PBF level and change in PBF level at 3-month follow-up. Outcome following the management of dental injuries may be predicted from variables collected from LDF and physical examination. Predictive modelling may provide clinicians with the opportunity to identify 'at-risk' patients early and initiate specific treatment approaches."

Since the 1980s, osseointegrated dental implants have dramatically improved the therapeutic possibilities, especially so for maladaptive patients. Those able to access such treatment can expect significant improvements in oral functional status and quality of life. While there is a downward trend in edentulism in several countries, it is region-specific, confirming the overriding influence of socio-economic factors on health status. In most societies, despite ageing populations, the need for complete dentures is not likely to reduce in the near future. Whereas a two- or even a one-implant overdenture for the edentulous mandible is increasingly regarded as a minimum standard of care in many developed countries, its routine prescription for the majority in the world who are disadvantaged is unrealistic; for them, even 'low-tech' therapies like conventional dentures are beyond their reach. Improving the conventional management of edentulous patients is a necessity and requires a keener focus by researchers, educators and clinicians in the developed world on the needs of populations with fewer resources."

The aims of the study were to compare the primary stability of implant inserted into extraction sockets by using RF with cable, RF wireless and new wireless MM device, to clarify the relation between these devices and to understand the correlations between peri-implant bone levels and implant stability. A total of 30 screw-type implants (3.75 x 11 and 4.2 x 11 mm) were inserted into extraction sockets of eight mandibular pre-molar regions of human cadavers. The primary stability of implants was measured by three devices after insertion. Peri-implant vertical defects were created in millimetre increments ranging between 0 and 5 mm, and stability/mobility of implants were analysed. At placement, the mean implant stability quotient of RF with cable, RF wireless and MM device values was 46 +/- 1, 57.8 +/- 9 and -5.4 +/- 1, respectively. Statistical correlations were demonstrated between these devices (P = 0.001). Statistically significant differences were presented for all peri-implant detects ranging between 0 and 5 mm for RF with cable and RF wireless at all increments. However, only a significant decrease was found between 0 and 1 mm defects, and 4 and 5 mm defects in MM device. Although RF with cable and RF wireless seem to be suitable to detect peri-implant bone loss around implants in 1 mm increments, the new MM device may not be suitable to detect the 1 mm peri-implant bone changes in human dried cadaver mandibles."

Thrombin generation was determined using calibrated automated thrombography.Results:Full-length TFPI levels were lower in type I protein S-deficient individuals (76.8+/-33.8%) than in age- and sex-matched controls (128.0+/-59.4%, P<0.001). Among protein S-deficient individuals with thrombosis, those on OAT had not only lower total protein S levels (25.7+/-8.2% vs. 54.7+/-8.2%, P<0.001), but also lower full-length TFPI levels (52.6+/-15.0% vs. 75.4+/-22.9%, P=0.009) than those not on OAT. Similarly, OC users had lower protein S (73.8+/-11.5% vs. 87.9+/-10.8%, P=0.005) and full-length TFPI levels (73.7+/-27.7% vs. 106.4+/-29.2%, P=0.007) than non-users. When triggered with tissue factor, plasma from protein S-deficient individuals generated 3-5-fold more thrombin than control plasma. The difference was only partially corrected by normalization of the protein S level, full correction requiring additional normalization of the TFPI level. Protein S-immunodepletion experiments indicated that free protein S and full-length TFPI form a complex in plasma, and the protein S/TFPI interaction was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance analysis.Conclusions:Full-length TFPI binds to protein S in plasma and is reduced in genetic and acquired protein S deficiency. The concomitant TFPI deficiency substantially contributes to the hypercoagulable state associated with protein S deficiency."

Functional abnormalities of this pathway, which manifest themselves in vitro as a poor anticoagulant response of plasma to added APC (APC resistance), are prevalent in the general population and are associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. APC resistance was originally discovered in thrombophilic families and later shown to be associated with the common FV Arg506Gln (FV(Leiden)) mutation, which abolishes one of the APC-cleavage sites in FV. Although FV(Leiden) is the major cause of hereditary APC resistance, it is becoming increasingly clear that several other genetic and acquired conditions contribute to APC resistance and thereby increase the risk of venous thrombosis. This paper reviews the multifactorial etiology of APC resistance and discusses its clinical implications."

Nevertheless, this relatively old mutation is prevalent in Caucasion populations, which could be explained by positive selection pressure. Men with FVL have previously been found to have higher fecundity (the time between marriage and first pregnancy). Whether this is caused by increased sperm counts in men with FVL is unknown.Objectives:To assess whether men with factor V Leiden have increased sperm counts.Patients/methods:We performed a prospective cohort study among 1139 consecutively included male partners of subfertile couples presenting at our university hospital for fertility workup between January 2000 and July 2007. All potential candidates who gave informed consent were included, irrespective of their fertility workup. In this retrospective analysis, we excluded participants with known causes of spermatogenic function or azoospermia. Subsequently, we genotyped all participants and compared sperm counts between FVL carriers and non-carriers.Results:We identified 37 FVL carriers and 921 non-carriers. FVL carriers had higher total sperm counts and total motile sperm counts than non-carriers: 236 x 10(6) (95% CI 158-292 x 10(6)) vs. 163 x 10(6) (95% CI 147-178 x 10(6)) and 81 x 10(6) (95% CI 54-105 x 10(6)) vs. 52 x 10(6) (95% CI 48-57 x 10(6)), respectively.Conclusions:To our knowledge, this is the first study that indicates that an increased incidence of a genotype may be controlled by increased sperm counts. However, the finding that men with FVL had higher total (motile) sperm counts was not statistically significant and needs confirmation in other studies."

Phylogenetic data revealed four zebrafish orthologous for three human MLCK genes. To investigate expression of the zebrafish mlck genes in thrombocytes we compared GFP-tagged platelets with other cells by microarray analysis, and showed that mlck1a expression was 4.5-fold enriched in platelets. Furthermore, mlck1a mRNA and mRNA for the platelet-specific cd41 co-localized in thrombi. Expression of other mlck subtypes was lower in GFP-tagged platelets (mlck1b; 0.77-fold enriched) and absent in thrombi (mlck1b, -2, -3). To investigate the role of Mlck1a in thrombus formation, we knocked down mlck1a using two morpholinos. This resulted in impaired morphology changes of platelets adhering on fibrinogen. In a thrombosis model, in which thrombocytes adhere to the vessel wall damaged by laser irradiation, thrombus formation was slowed down in mlck1a-deficient embryos.Conclusion:We conclude that Mlck1a is the subtype of MLCK that contributes to platelet shape change and thrombus formation."

The large majority of them (92%) underwent coronary (endovascular or surgical) revascularization. During the follow-up, 91 (14.3%) out of 633 patients died, with 64 events (10.1%) attributed to cardiovascular causes. After adjustment for all the other predictors of mortality during univariate analysis (i.e. age, statin therapy, myocardial infarction history, diabetes, hs-CRP and creatinine), elevated apo C-III levels (> or = 10.5 mg dL(-1)- the median value) significantly predicted both total and cardiovascular mortality (HR for total mortality 2.22 with 95% CI 1.16-4.24; HR for cardiovascular mortality 2.35 with 95% CI 1.19-4.62). In a subgroup of 225 subjects, apo C-III levels were significantly associated with endogenous thrombin potential in regression models (standardized beta coefficient = 0.207, P = 0.002).Conclusions:Basal concentrations of apo C-III levels > or = 10.5 mg dL(-1) in CAD patients independently predicted cardiovascular mortality during the subsequent 5-year period. Such concentrations were associated with an enhanced plasma endogenous thrombin generation, suggesting a complex interplay between TG-rich particles and the coagulation cascade as well as a new 'thrombogenetic' role for apo C-III."

Antagonists of alpha(IIb)beta(3), for example abciximab, tirofiban and eptifibatide, are used in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes. However, in addition to effective blockade of the integrin, binding of can induce conformational changes in the integrin and can also induce integrin clustering. This class effect of RGD-ligand mimetics might, therefore, underlie paradoxical platelet activation and thrombosis previously reported.Objectives:To examine the components of signaling pathways and functional responses in platelets that may underlie this phenomenon of paradoxical platelet activation.Methods:We assessed the effect of lotrafiban, and other alpha(IIb)beta(3) antagonists including the clinically used drug tirofiban, on tyrosine phosphorylation of key signaling proteins in platelets by immunoblotting and also platelet functional outputs such as cytosolic calcium responses, phosphatidylserine exposure (pro-coagulant activity) and dense granule release.Results:In all cases, no effect of alpha(IIb)beta(3) antagonists were observed on their own, but these integrin antagonists did lead to a marked potentiation of glycoprotein VI (GPVI)-associated FcR gamma-chain phosphorylation, activation of Src family kinases and Syk kinase. This correlated with increased dense granule secretion, cytosolic calcium response and exposure of phosphatidylserine on the platelet surface. P2Y(12) antagonism abolished the potentiated phosphatidylserine exposure and dense granule secretion but not the cytosolic calcium response.Conclusions:These data provide a mechanism for enhancement of platelet activity by alpha(IIb)beta(3) inhibitors, but also reveal a potentially important signaling pathway operating from the integrin to GPVI signaling."

Thrombin binding to polyphosphate was influenced by ionic strength, and was evident even in plasma. Two positively charged exosites on thrombin mediate its interactions with other proteins and accessory molecules: exosite I (mainly with thrombin substrates), and exosite II (mainly with certain anionic polymers). Free thrombin, thrombin in complex with hirudin's C-terminal dodecapeptide and gamma-thrombin all bound polyphosphate similarly, excluding exosite I involvement. Mutations within exosite II, but not within exosite I, the Na(+)-binding site or hydrophobic pocket, weakened thrombin binding to polyphosphate as revealed by NaCl dependence. Surface plasmon resonance demonstrated tight interaction of polyphosphate with thrombin (K(d) approximately 5 nm) but reduced interaction with a thrombin exosite II mutant. Certain glycosaminoglycans, including heparin, only partially competed with polyphosphate for binding to thrombin, and polyphosphate did not reduce heparin-catalyzed inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin.Conclusion:Polyphosphate interacts with thrombin's exosite II at a site that partially overlaps with, but is not identical to, the heparin-binding site. Polyphosphate interactions with thrombin may be physiologically relevant, as the polyphosphate concentrations achievable following platelet activation are far above the approximately 5 nM K(d) for the polyphosphate-thrombin interaction."

        "Abstract": "Platelet activation is a complex balance of positive and negative signaling pathways. The protein kinase C (PKC) family is a major regulator of platelet granule secretion, integrin activation, aggregation, spreading and procoagulant activity. As broad-spectrum PKC inhibitors reduce secretion and aggregation, the PKC family is generally considered to be a positive regulator of platelet activation. However, the individual members of the PKC family that are expressed in platelets are regulated in different ways, and an increasing body of evidence indicates that they have distinct, and often opposing, roles. Many of the recent advances in understanding the contributions of individual PKC isoforms have come from mouse gene knockout studies. PKCalpha, a classic isoform, is an essential positive regulator of granule secretion and thrombus formation, both in vitro and in vivo. Mice lacking PKCalpha show much reduced thrombus formation in vivo but do not have a bleeding defect, suggesting that PKCalpha could be an attractive antithrombotic target. Important, apparently non-redundant, roles, both positive and negative, for the novel PKC isoforms delta, theta and epsilon in granule secretion have also been proposed, indicating highly complex regulation of this essential process. Similarly, PKCbeta, PKCdelta and PKCtheta have non-redundant roles in platelet spreading, as absence of either PKCbeta or PKCtheta reduces spreading, whereas PKCdelta negatively regulates filopodial formation. This negative signaling by PKCdelta may reduce platelet aggregation and so restrict thrombus formation. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the regulation and functions of individual PKC isoforms in platelet activation and thrombus formation."

The objective of this project was to modify the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement to reflect the unique aspects of reporting these livestock trials. A 2-day consensus meeting was held on November 18-19, 2008 in Chicago, IL, to achieve the objective. Before the meeting, a Web-based survey was conducted to identify issues for discussion. The 24 attendees were biostatisticians, epidemiologists, food-safety researchers, livestock production specialists, journal editors, assistant editors, and associate editors. Before the meeting, the attendees completed a Web-based survey indicating which CONSORT statement items would need to be modified to address unique issues for livestock trials. The consensus meeting resulted in the production of the REFLECT (Reporting Guidelines for Randomized Control Trials) statement for livestock and food safety and 22-item checklist. Fourteen items were modified from the CONSORT checklist, and an additional subitem was proposed to address challenge trials. The REFLECT statement proposes new terminology, more consistent with common usage in livestock production, to describe study subjects. Evidence was not always available to support modification to or inclusion of an item. The use of the REFLECT statement, which addresses issues unique to livestock trials, should improve the quality of reporting and design for trials reporting production, health, and food-safety outcomes."

Cases were identified by a diagnostic laboratory, the attending clinicians were contacted and the medical records were reviewed. The Babesia sp. 18S rRNA genes were amplified and sequenced.Results:Six of 7 dogs had been splenectomized; the remaining dog was receiving oncolytic drugs.

The 18S rRNA gene sequences were determined to be identical to a large unnamed Babesia sp. previously isolated. Cross-reactive antibodies against other Babesia spp. were not always detectable. Five dogs were treated with imidocarb dipropionate and 1 dog with atovaquone/azithromycin; some favorable responses were noted. The remaining dog was untreated and remained a clinically stable carrier.Conclusions and clinical importance:Dogs with pigmenturia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia should be tested for Babesia sp. by PCR. Serology is not sufficient for diagnosis of this Babesia sp. Asplenia, chemotherapy, or both might represent risk factors for persistent infection, illness, or both."

        "Abstract": "Background:Von Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen concentration, a marker of endothelial activation, is increased in human patients with multiorgan failure, sepsis, or both, and is an independent predictor of survival.Hypothesis/objectives:vWF antigen concentrations are significantly higher in dogs with sepsis.Animals:Fourteen dogs hospitalized with sepsis. Sepsis was defined as microbiologic or cytologic evidence of infection combined with systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Control dogs were healthy dogs, without evidence of disease.Methods:Prospective, observational study. Dogs admitted to the intensive care unit with a diagnosis of sepsis were considered eligible for enrollment into the study. Exclusion criteria included a previous diagnosis of von Willebrand disease or a recent history of a plasma transfusion. Citrated plasma samples were collected for analysis of vWF antigen by ELISA. All samples were drawn from dogs during hospitalization. Data between populations were analyzed using nonparametric statistical analysis with a P value < .05 considered significant.Results:Twenty-five dogs were enrolled; 14 dogs with sepsis and 11 control dogs. The median vWF antigen concentration in dogs with sepsis was 156% (range, 117-200%), which was significantly higher than healthy dogs (105%; range, 44-155%, P < .005). There was no difference between survivors and nonsurvivors with a median vWF antigen concentration of 144% (range, 136-201%) in survivors (n = 7) and 159% (range, 122-174%) in nonsurvivors (n = 7) (P = .5).Conclusions and clinical importance:vWF is increased in dogs with sepsis, possibly reflecting endothelial activation. Further exploration of endothelial function is warranted in critically ill dogs."

Histopathology slides from sequential cases undergoing endoscopic biopsy were examined by 4 pathologists by pictorial templates. Changes for 9 microscopic features were recorded as normal, mild, moderate or severe, and 2- and 4-point scales were tested for consistency of interpretation. Logistic regression models determined odds ratios (OR) of histologic lesions being associated with hypoalbuminemia while kappa statistics determined agreement between pathologists on histologic lesions.Results:There was poor agreement (kappa = -0.013 to 0.3) between pathologists, and institution of origin of slides had effect (kappa = 1.0 for 3 of 4 lesions on slides from Institution 5) on agreement between pathologists on selected histologic features. Using 2 point as opposed to 4-point grading scale increased agreement between pathologists (maximum kappa = 0.69 using 4-point scale versus maximum kappa = 1.0 using 2-point scale). Significant association (P = .019- .04; 95% OR = 3.14-10.84) between lacteal dilation and hypoalbuminemia was found by 3 pathologists.Conclusions and clinical importance:Substantial inconsistency between pathologists remains despite use of pictorial template because of differences in slide processing. Distinguishing between mild and moderate lesions might be important source of the disagreement among pathologists."

Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is a circulating biomarker of cardiac damage.Hypothesis:Myocardial damage can occur in dogs with precapillary and postcapillary PH.Animals:One hundred and thirty-three dogs were examined: 26 healthy controls, 42 dogs with mitral valve disease (MVD) without PH, 48 dogs with pulmonary hypertension associated with mitral valve disease (PH-MVD), and 17 dogs with precapillary PH.Methods:Prospective, observational study. Serum cTnI concentration was measured with a commercially available immunoassay and results were compared between groups.Results:Median cTnI was 0.10 ng/mL (range 0.10-0.17 ng/mL) in healthy dogs. Compared with the healthy population, median serum cTnI concentration was increased in dogs with precapillary PH (0.25 ng/mL; range 0.10-1.9 ng/mL; P < .001) and in dogs with PH-MVD (0.21 ng/mL; range 0.10-2.10 ng/mL; P < .001). Median serum cTnI concentration of dogs with MVD (0.12 ng/mL; range 0.10-1.00 ng/mL) was not significantly different compared with control group and dogs with PH-MVD. In dogs with MVD and PH-MVD, only the subgroup with decompensated PH-MVD had significantly higher cTnI concentration compared with dogs with compensated MVD and PH-MVD. Serum cTnI concentration showed significant modest positive correlations with the calculated pulmonary artery systolic pressure in dogs with PH and some echocardiographic indices in dogs with MVD and PH-MVD.Conclusions and clinical importance:Serum cTnI is high in dogs with either precapillary and postcapillary PH. Myocardial damage in dogs with postcapillary PH is likely the consequence of increased severity of MVD."

Only case reports or small case series evaluating naturally infected dogs have been published.Objective:Describe clinical signs in dogs naturally infected with HA.Animals:Twenty-two dogs naturally infected with HA from 1985 to 2009.Methods:Retrospective study. All medical records were searched for HA and schistosomiasis. Only dogs with a diagnosis based on identification of ova on histopathology or fecal saline sedimentation were included.Results:The median age was 3.1 years (1-12). The median duration of clinical signs before diagnosis was 0.63 months (0.03-12). The most common clinical signs were lethargy (91%), weight loss (77%), hyporexia (68%), vomiting (59%), and diarrhea (55%). Eleven of the 22 dogs were hypercalcemic. Hypercalcemia did not resolve without definitive treatment with praziquantel. HA infection was an incidental diagnosis in 7/22 dogs. Diagnosis was obtained via necropsy (4), histopathology (9), and fecal examination (9). Definitive treatment included praziquantel and fenbendazole. Eighteen dogs were diagnosed antemortem and 17 were treated. Twelve dogs were alive for 6 months to 3 years after diagnosis.Conclusions and clinical importance:HA infection occurs in younger, larger breed, indoor dogs. Hypercalcemia does not resolve without praziquantel treatment. Prognosis is good and neither hypercalcemic-induced renal failure nor ascites appears to worsen prognosis. Dogs in affected areas or that have traveled to affected areas that present for weight loss, gastrointestinal or liver disease, and hypercalcemia, should be tested."

Age- and sex-dependent variations in cTnI concentration have been described.Objective:To investigate whether plasma concentrations of cTnI and CRP are associated with severity of MMVD, and investigate potential associations of dog characteristics on cTnI and CRP concentrations.Animals:Eighty-one client-owned dogs with MMVD of varying severity.Methods:Dogs were prospectively recruited for the study. Dogs were classified according to severity of MMVD. Plasma cTnI was analyzed by a high sensitivity cTnI assay with a lower limit of detection of 0.001 ng/mL, and plasma CRP was analyzed by a canine-specific CRP ELISA.Results:Higher cTnI concentrations were detected in dogs with moderate (0.014 [interquartile range 0.008-0.029] ng/mL, P = .0011) and severe (0.043 [0.031-0.087] ng/mL, P < .0001) MMVD, compared with healthy dogs (0.001 [0.001-0.004]ng/mL). Dogs with severe MMVD also had higher cTnI concentrations than dogs with mild (0.003 [0.001-0.024] ng/mL, P < .0001) and moderate (P = .0019) MMVD. There were significant associations of age, CRP, heart rate, and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, on cTnI concentration C-reactive protein did not differ among severity groups, but was significantly associated with cTnI, breed, and systolic blood pressure on CRP concentration.Conclusions and clinical importance:Analysis of cTnI concentration has potential to increase knowledge of overall cardiac remodeling in dogs with MMVD. However, effect of age on cTnI needs consideration when assessing cTnI."

Comparisons were made by kappa analysis.Results:Microscopic pathology was observed in 30 cases. Only eight out of this 30 (27%) had the same histopathologic diagnosis in both the duodenum and the ileum. This dropped to 3 out of 30 (10%) if different disease severity was also considered as disagreement. Microscopic pathology would have been found in 60% and 80% of the 30 cases, if only duodenal or ileal biopsies respectively, had been available.Conclusions and clinical importance:There was poor agreement between histopathological findings from duodenal versus ileal biopsies with abnormalities sometimes being more readily detected in the ileum. Routine collection of ileal plus duodenal samples appears warranted when concurrent small and large intestinal diarrhea is present."

CGMS accuracy was compared with a reference glucose meter at normal, high, and low blood glucose concentrations using error grid analysis. Reading variability of 2 simultaneously used CGMS was determined in diabetic cats by calculating correlation and percentage of concordance of paired data at different glycemic ranges. The time interval between increasing glycemia and a rise in interstitial fluid glucose measured by the CGMS was assessed in healthy cats receiving glucose IV; the time point of maximal increase in interstitial glucose concentrations was calculated.Results:The CGMS was 100, 96.1, and 91.0% accurate at normal, high, and low blood glucose concentrations. Measurements deviated from reference by -12.7 +/- 70.5 mg/dL at normal, -12.1 +/- 141.5 mg/dL at high, and -1.9 +/- 40.9 mg/dL at low glucose concentrations. Overall, paired CGMS readings correlated significantly (r = 0.95, P < .0001) and concordance was 95.7%. The median delay after IV administration of glucose to an increase in interstitial glucose was 11.4 minutes (range: 8.8-19.7 minutes).Conclusions and clinical importance:Although some readings substantially deviated from reference values, the CGMS yields reproducible results, is clinically accurate in cats with hyperglycemia and euglycemia, and is slightly less accurate if blood glucose concentrations are low. Rapidly increasing interstitial glucose after a glycemic rise suggests that the CGMS is suitable for real-time measurement under clinical conditions."

The aim of this study was to examine the association of HCV/HIV co-infection with outcomes of hospitalized patients compared to those with HCV or HIV monoinfection. Using the 2006 Nationwide Inpatient Sample, patients with HCV or HIV monoinfection or HCV/HIV co-infection were identified using ICD-9-CM codes. We compared liver-related and infection-related admission between the three groups of patients. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. A total of 474,843 discharges with HCV monoinfection, 206,758 with HIV monoinfection and 56,304 with HCV/HIV co-infection were included. Liver-related admissions were more common in co-infected patients (15.4%) compared to those with HIV monoinfection (3.3%, P < 0.001). Primary infectious hospitalizations were more common in HIV monoinfection (33.9%) compared to co-infected patients (26%, P < 0.001). HCV/HIV co-infection was associated with higher mortality compared to HCV monoinfection (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.20-1.65) but not when compared to monoinfected-HIV patients. HCV-associated cirrhosis or complications thereof conferred four times greater mortality risk in patients with HIV (OR 3.96, 95% CI 3.29-4.79). The rate of hospitalization for HCV/HIV co-infected patients (23.5%) was significantly higher than those with HCV (14.8%) or HIV (19.9%) (P < 0.001). HCV/HIV co-infection is associated with significantly higher rates of hospitalization and is a risk factor for in-hospital mortality compared to patients with isolated HCV."

We conducted a cross-sectional study of adult men and women in a peri-urban community of Karachi (Jam Kandah). Households were selected through systematic sampling from within all villages in the study area. All available adults within each household were interviewed about potential HCV risk factors. A blood specimen was collected to test for anti-HCV antibodies by enzyme immunoassay. We used generalized estimating equations while accounting for correlation of responses within villages to identify the factors associated with HCV infection. Of 1997 participants, 476 (23.8%) were anti-HCV positive. Overall, HCV infection was significantly associated with increasing age, ethnicity, and having received > or =2 blood transfusions, > or =3 hospitalizations, dental treatment and >5 injections among women. Among women, > or =2 blood transfusions [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.32], >5 injections during the past 6 months (aORs = 1.47), dental treatment (aOR = 1.31) and increasing age(aOR = 1.49), while among men, extramarital sexual intercourse (aOR = 2.77), at least once a week shave from barber (aOR = 5.04), > or =3 hospitalizations (aOR = 2.50) and increasing age (aOR = 1.28) were associated with HCV infection. A very high prevalence of HCV was found in the study population. Among women, unsafe health care practices, while among men extramarital sex, shaving from a barber and hospitalizations were associated with HCV infection. Efforts are needed to improve the safety of medical procedures to reduce the transmission of HCV in Pakistan [Corrections made in Summary after initial online publication.]."

        "Abstract": "Transient elastometry (TE) could provide a more accurate evaluation of the frequency and risk factors of liver fibrosis in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection than that based on biopsy. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of and factors associated with significant liver fibrosis in a large population of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, who had participated in a cross-sectional, multicenter, retrospective study of liver fibrosis using noninvasive markers and in whom a determination of liver stiffness (LS) by TE was available, were included in this analysis. Factors potentially associated with significant fibrosis (LS ≥ 9 kPa) were analyzed. One thousand three hundred and ten patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 526 (40%) of them showed LS ≥ 9 kPa and 316 (24%) cirrhosis (LS ≥ 14 kPa). The factors independently associated with significant fibrosis [adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval, P value) were the following: older age [1.04 (1.01-1.07), 0.002], daily alcohol intake > 50 g/day [1.58 (1.10-2.27), 0.013] and the length of HCV infection [1.03 (1.00-1.06), 0.023]]. A CD4 cell count lower than < 200 per mm(3) [1.67 (0.99-2.81), 0.053] and HCV genotype 4 [0.66 (0.42-1.02), 0.066] were marginally associated with LS ≥ 9 kPa. In conclusion, the prevalence of cirrhosis in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients seems to be higher than previously reported in studies based on liver biopsy. Older age, alcohol consumption and lower CD4 cell counts are related with significant fibrosis. The latter association supports an earlier starting of antiretroviral therapy in this setting."

        "Abstract": "Infection with the hepatitis C virus commonly occurs in patient groups who have difficulty accessing conventional medical care, reducing their chance of successful antiviral therapy. Managed care networks (MCNs) have been suggested as a mechanism of improving access to care; however, there is little evidence to support their use in patients with hepatitis C. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a MCN for patients with hepatitis C. This was a retrospective cohort study of all individuals in our area who had received a positive hepatitis C antibody test between August 1994 and June 2008. The MCN introduced a new referral pathway, which included nonmedical referrals and outreach nurse-led clinics. These interventions were introduced in 2004 and evaluated in 2008. After the introduction of the MCN, the proportion of individuals who accessed care increased from 61% (280/430) to 82.4% (721/875). There was an increase in nonmedical referrals with 81 (18.3%) being directly referred from Drug Problem Services and 75 (17%) from the Prison Service. The changes to referral did not have a negative impact on treatment outcomes as the number who completed treatment increased from 66.1% (43/65) to 73.7% (98/133) and the sustained virological response increased from 50.7% (33/65) to 60.9% (81/133). This study provides evidence that the collaboration of health care professionals within a network can have a radical effect in improving access to care in a traditionally hard to reach population. This has been achieved with little additional resource, but rather working smarter with existing staff."

Our goal was to examine and compare treatment outcomes in these patients with genotypes 1 vs 2/3 vs 6. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 167 consecutive treatment-naïve Asian American patients treated with pegylated interferon (PEG IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) at two community clinics in Northern California from 12/00 to 1/08. Primary outcome was sustained virological response rate by intention-to-treat analysis. The overall completion rate was 76%, and treatment adherence (completion of ≥ 75-80% PEG IFN + RBV dose for ≥ 75-80% of intended duration) was 74%. Significant depression was noted in only 4% of patients. Sustained virologic response in patients with genotype 6 treated for 48 weeks was similar to that seen in those with genotype 2/3 (74%vs 75%, P = 0.89) and significantly higher than those with genotype 1 (74%vs 49%, P = 0.016). On multivariate analysis inclusive of sex, age, body mass index (≤ 25 vs > 25) and viral load, only treatment adherence and genotype (2/3 and 6 treated for 48 weeks) were found to be significant predictors of sustained virologic response. We conclude that significant depression is rare in Asian American patients (4%). Patients with genotype 6 treated for 48 weeks appear to have a similar treatment response rate as patients with genotype 2/3 and a significantly higher response rate than those with genotype 1."

Functional coding region polymorphism F31I in the Aurora A gene has recently been shown to be associated with several human cancers, but its association with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has yet to be investigated. Genetic polymorphism of Aurora A was investigated in 128 confirmed subjects with HCC and 128 cancer-free control subjects matched on age, gender, smoking and alcohol consumption by using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Allele and genotype associations of Aurora A F31I polymorphism with HCC susceptibility were observed in comparisons between the patient and control samples (respectively; P = 0.005, P = 0.012). The proportion of the genotypes containing I31 allele in patients with HCC (39.8%) was significantly higher than that in patients without HCC (22.7%) (P = 0.003). The distribution F31I genotype was significantly associated with increased risk of HCC (P = 0.003, odds ratio = 2.26, 95% confidence interval = 1.31-3.90 for FI + II genotypes vs FF genotype). Our results suggest for the first time that the Aurora A F31I polymorphism may be a genetic susceptibility factor for HCC."

Chemerin and vaspin are recently described adipocytokines with various suggested functions and potential to modulate inflammatory response and insulin resistance (IR). We assessed chemerin, vaspin and leptin serum concentration and studied their association with IR laboratory and morphological features in patients with hepatitis C. The study included 40 patients with hepatitis C and 20 healthy volunteers, similar in age and body mass index (43.6 +/- 11.6 vs 40.9 +/- 11.8 years and 25.0 +/- 4.1 vs 23.9 +/- 3.3 kg/m(2), respectively). Patients had to have a normal lipid profile, and diabetes was an exclusion criteria. Serum chemerin and leptin levels and IR were significantly higher in patients with hepatitis C when compared to the controls (P = 0.02, P = 0.02 and P = 0.02, respectively), whereas vaspin level was significantly decreased (P = 0.01). Serum chemerin was negatively associated with necro-inflammatory grade (r = (-0.49), P = 0.01). The lowest levels of serum chemerin were found in patients with moderate/severe inflammation (P = 0.03). Serum leptin tended to be up-regulated in patients with minimal inflammatory activity. Serum vaspin was higher, although not significantly, when fibrosis was more advanced. IR was positively associated with fibrosis stage (r = 0.33, P = 0.03). Serum chemerin and leptin were related to each other (r = 0.45, P = 0.02).Our findings support a complex interaction between the analysed adipokines and pathogenesis of inflammatory process in CHC. The role of chemerin and vaspin in pathogenesis of inflammatory response should be further investigated."

        "Abstract": "Fatigue is a major component of quality of life (QOL) and is associated with depression in HIV-HCV co-infected individuals. We investigated whether treating depressive symptoms (DS) could mitigate the impact of fatigue on daily functioning in co-infected patients, even those at an advanced stage of disease. The analysis was conducted on enrollment data of 328 HIV-HCV co-infected patients recruited in the French nationwide ANRS CO 13 HEPAVIH cohort. Data collection was based on medical records and self-administered questionnaires which included items on socio-behavioural data, the fatigue impact scale (FIS) in three domains (cognitive, physical and social functioning), depressive symptoms (CES-D classification) and use of treatments for depressive symptoms (TDS). After multiple adjustment for gender and unemployment, CD4 cell count <200 per mm(3) was associated with a negative impact of fatigue on the physical functioning dimension (P = 0.002). A higher number of symptoms causing discomfort significantly predicted a higher impact of fatigue on all three dimensions (P < 0.001). This was also true for patients with DS receiving TDS when compared with those with no DS but receiving TDS. A significant decreasing linear trend (P < 0.001) of the impact of fatigue was found across the categories 'DS/TDS', 'DS/no TDS', 'no DS/TDS' and 'no DS/no TDS'. Despite limitations related to the cross-sectional nature of this study, our results suggest that routine screening and treatment for DS can reduce the impact of fatigue on the daily functioning of HIV-HCV co-infected patients and relieve the burden of their dual infection."

HBV undergoes numerous rounds of error prone production within an infected host. The resulting quasispecies are heterogeneous and in the absence of archaeological records of past infection, the evolution of HBV can only be inferred indirectly from its epidemiology and by genetic analysis. This review gathered the controversies about the HBV origin and factors influencing its quasispecies. Also, it provided some evidence on how HBV genotypes correlated with human history and patterns of migration. It is our belief that this topic deserves further attention and thus it is likely that more critical research work will be performed to elucidate the unknown mechanisms and processes in this area."

The first feature is the presence of two ribosomal gene clusters located in tandem to one another (the inter-ribosomal spacer, IRS). This characteristic is present in the Edwardsiella genus but absent in the other sequenced members of the Enterobacteriaceae. The second feature is the presence of an intervening sequence (IVS) in the 23S rRNA gene of Edw. ictaluri. To verify the specificity of this assay, we tested genomic DNA from a variety of bacterial species. The IVS/IRS PCR assay results in an c. 2000-bp product from all Edw. ictaluri isolates tested, but not from any other species including Edwardsiella tarda.Conclusions:The IVS/IRS PCR assay is highly specific for Edw. ictaluri and useful as a tool for identifying this pathogen.Significance and impact of the study:This research verifies the specificity of PCR-based assay for Edw. Ictaluri, and we describe this assay as a highly versatile diagnostic tool for its identification."

In addition, PmalE1 was not functional in Escherichia coli, in which Pgit1 function was repressible, which enabled the cloning of a hitherto 'difficult-to-clone' heterologous gene of a lignocellulolytic enzyme, whose secretion was consequently induced by the carbon sources.Conclusions:PmalE1 and Pgit1 are strong, carbon source-inducible promoters of C. glutamicum whose characteristics in E. coli are integral to the secretion ability of C. glutamicum to secrete lignocellulolytic enzyme.Significance and impact of the study:Corynebacterium glutamicum, like its counterpart industrial workhorses E. coli and Bacillus subtilis, does exhibit strong, carbon source-inducible promoters, and the functionality of two of which was demonstrated in this study. While this study may be most relevant in the ongoing efforts to establish technologies of the biorefinery, it should also be of interest to general microbiologists exploring the versatility of industrial micro-organisms. In so doing, the study should impact future advances in industrial microbiology."

The recombinant clones were selected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Recombinant protein was expressed using induction with 1 mmol l(-1) final concentration of isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG). Polyclonal antibodies were raised in mice against this purified recombinant protein. An indirect plate ELISA was standardized based on rAil protein for the detection of Y. enterocolitica. Western blot analysis with the sera raised against recombinant Ail protein exhibited reaction at 17 kDa region of the native Ail protein present in pathogenic Y. enterocolitica standard strains and strains isolated from pork samples suggesting that the antigenicity of recombinant Ail protein was similar to that of native Ail protein. Nonpathogenic Y. enterocolitica and the other species of Yersinia, namely, Y. pseudotuberculosis, Y. intermedia, Y. kristenseni, Y. fredrickseni and also the Enterobacteriaceae organisms tested were not found reacting to polyclonal antisera against this recombinant Ail protein.Conclusion:The antibodies raised against recombinant Ail protein could specifically identify pathogenic Y. enterocolitica strains both by indirect plate ELISA and Western blot immunoassay.Significance and impact of the study:The method developed in this study may find application in the detection of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica not only from food and environmental samples but also from clinical samples."

This work focuses on the isolation of Campylobacter coli lytic bacteriophages (phages) against target C. coli strains.Methods and results:A method involving the enrichment of free-range chicken samples in a broth containing the target C. coli strains and salts (CaCl(2) and MgSO(4)) was used for phage isolation. This method allowed the isolation of 43 phages that were active against 83% of the C. coli strains used in the isolation procedure. Approximately 65% of the phages were also effective against Campylobacter jejuni strains.Conclusions:The use of target pathogens in the phage isolation step improves the likelihood of detecting and isolating phages for the control of these specific strains.Significance and impact of the study:This technique will be valuable in the context of phage therapy for enriching for phages that are active against specifically identified strains of bacteria, for example from a food poisoning outbreak or epidemic strains resistant to multiple antibiotics. In these situations, using the conventional methods for searching for bacteriophages active for these particular strains can be a time-consuming, if not an unsuccessful process. Using the isolation method described in this manuscript, the particular strains can be added to the enrichment broth increasing the probability of finding phages against them. Therefore, it will shorten the time needed for seeking phages able to lyse target strains, which in most of the cases, because of the rapid increase in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, is of crucial importance."

Southern hybridization analysis of restricted genomic DNA of SRMT demonstrated that the mutant had a single Tn5 insert. SRM increased in titre to about 2 x 10(8) CFU g(-1) root, compared with the indigenous bacterial population of heterotrophs of about 5 x 10(7) CFU g(-1) root. In contrast, 30 days later, the titre value of SRMT was almost undetectable at 1 x 10(2) CFU g(-1) root, demonstrating its inability to survive and colonize the rhizosphere. Sequencing of the flanking region of the Tn5 mutant revealed that Tn5 disrupted the purB gene.Conclusions:A defect in the colonization phenotype of the SRMT was attributed to the disruption in adenylosuccinate lyase (EC 4.3.2.2) which is encoded by the pur B gene and is required for rhizosphere colonization in P. agglomerans. Significantly less exopolysaccharide and biofilm was formed by SRMT when compared to SRM, because of the disruption of the purB gene.Significance and impact of the study:This work provides the first evidence for a functional role of purB gene in rhizosphere competence and root colonization by any rhizobacteria."

We found that already a low concentration of the peptide LL37 (1 mg l(-1)) significantly decreased both the attachment of bacteria to the surface and also the biofilm mass. No growth inhibition was observed even at 16 mg l(-1) concentration of LL37, indicating a direct effect of the peptide on biofilm production.Conclusions:As biofilm protects bacteria during infections in humans and allows their survival in a hostile environment, inhibition of biofilm formation by LL37 may have a key role to prevent bacterial colonization on indwelling devices.Significance and impact of the study:Our findings suggest that this host defence factor can be a potential candidate in prevention and treatment strategies of Staph. epidermidis infections in humans."

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that appeared fixed within each species were characterized by DNA-sequencing pools of pure individuals. Thirty-five of these diagnostic SNPs were employed in a high-throughput assay that genotyped 635 trees of different age classes, sampled from 15 sites with various degrees of anthropogenic disturbance. The degree of admixture within sampled trees was then assessed through Bayesian clustering of genotypes. Hybrids were present in seven of the populations, with 2.4% of all sampled trees showing spontaneous admixture. Sites with hybrids were significantly more disturbed than pure stands, while hybrids comprised both immature juveniles and trees of reproductive age. All three possible F1s were detected. Advanced-generation hybrids were consistently biased towards P. balsamifera regardless of whether hybridization had occurred with P. deltoides or P. nigra. Gene exchange between P. deltoides and P. nigra was not detected beyond the F1 generation; however, detection of a trihybrid demonstrates that even this apparent reproductive isolation does not necessarily result in an evolutionary dead end. Collectively, results demonstrate the natural fertility of hybrid poplars and suggest that introduced genes could potentially affect the genetic integrity of native trees, similar to that arising from introgression between natives."

Ants play crucial roles in many ecological niches and the sequencing of several ant genomes promises to elucidate topics ranging from the genetic basis for social complexity, longevity and behaviour to systems biology and the identification of novel antimicrobial compounds. Unlike other species, most ant genomes are being generated by individual labs and small collaborations without the annotation and computational resources that support prominent model organism genome databases such those for the fruitfly and roundworm.

        "Abstract": "Interspecific mutualism can evolve when specific lineages of different species tend to be associated with each other from one generation to the next. Different maternally transmitted endosymbionts occurring within the same cytoplasmic lineage fulfil this requirement. Drosophila neotestacea is infected with maternally transmitted Wolbachia and Spiroplasma, which are cotransmitted at high frequency in natural populations. Molecular phylogenetic evidence indicates that both endosymbionts have been present in D. neotestacea for considerable evolutionary periods. Thus, conditions are suitable for the evolution of mutualism between them. In support of this possibility, there is a significant positive association between Wolbachia and Spiroplasma infection in many samples of D. neotestacea from natural populations. Theoretically, such a positive association can result from either mutualism between these endosymbionts or recent spread. Collections from present-day populations suggest that recent spread and mutualism have both operated to generate the positive association between Wolbachia and Spiroplasma. If selection acts on the combination of these two endosymbionts, they may be in the early stages of evolution of a more complex, cooperative association."

A collection of 411 Belgian P. ramorum isolates was established during a 7-year survey. Our main objectives were genetic characterization of this population to test for sexual reproduction, determination of population structure, evolution and spread, and evaluation of the effectiveness and impact of control measures. Novel, polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were developed after screening 149 candidate loci. Eighty isolates of P. ramorum, broadly representing the Belgian population, were analyzed using four previously described and three newly identified polymorphic microsatellite loci as well as amplified fragment length polymorphisms. SSR analysis was most informative and was used to screen the entire Belgian population. Thirty multilocus genotypes were identified, but 68% of the isolates belonged to the main genotype EU1MG1. Although accumulated mutation events were detected, the overall level of genetic diversity within the Belgian isolates of P. ramorum appears to be limited, indicating a relatively recent clonal expansion. Based on our SSR analysis there is no evidence of sexual recombination in the Belgian population of P. ramorum. Metalaxyl use decreased the genetic diversity of P. ramorum until 2005, when the majority of the isolates had become resistant. Most genotypes were site-specific and despite systematic removal of symptomatic and neighbouring plants, some genotypes were detected over a period of several years at a single site, sometimes discontinuously, indicating (latent) survival of the pathogen at those sites."

        "Abstract": "Major environmental events that fragment populations among multiple island habitats have potential to drive large-scale episodes of speciation and adaptive radiation. A recent palaeolimnological study of sediment cores indicated that Lake Malawi underwent major climate-driven desiccation events 75,000-135,000 years ago that lowered the water level to at least 580 m below the present state and severely reduced surface area. After this period, lake levels rose and stabilized, creating multiple discontinuous littoral rocky habitats. Here, we present evidence supporting the hypothesis that establishment and expansion of isolated philopatric rock cichlid populations occurred after this rise and stabilization of lake level. We studied the Pseudotropheus (Maylandia) species complex, a group with both allopatric and sympatric populations that differ in male nuptial colour traits and tend to mate assortatively. Using coalescent analyses based on mitochondrial DNA, we found evidence that populations throughout the lake started to expand and accumulate genetic diversity after the lake level rise. Moreover, most haplotypes were geographically restricted, and the greatest genetic similarities were typically among sympatric or neighbouring populations. This is indicative of limited dispersal and establishment of assortative mating among populations following the lake level rise. Together, this evidence is compatible with a single large-scale environmental event being central to evolution of spatial patterns of genetic and species diversity in P. (Maylandia) and perhaps other Lake Malawi rock cichlids. Equivalent climate-driven pulses of habitat formation and fragmentation may similarly have contributed to observed rapid and punctuated cladogenesis in other adaptive radiations."

The impacts of fragmentation depend strongly on dispersal abilities, but these are difficult to quantify. Here, we quantify and compare dispersal abilities of two bumblebee species, Bombus muscorum and Bombus jonellus, in a model island system. We use microsatellites to investigate population genetic structuring, dispersal and spatial patterns in genetic diversity. Populations of both species showed significant structuring, and isolation by distance, but this was markedly greater in B. muscorum (theta = 0.13) than in B. jonellus (theta = 0.034). This difference could reflect a higher effective population size in B. jonellus compared to B. muscorum, but this is not consistent with the observed abundance of the two species. We argue that it is more likely that B. jonellus has a higher propensity to disperse than B. muscorum. This will influence their relative susceptibility to habitat fragmentation and may in part explain differential declines of mainland populations of these and other bumblebee species."

        "Abstract": "Nothofagus pumilio is the dominant and almost ubiquitous tree species in mountainous environments of temperate South America. We used two types of molecular markers (cpDNA and isozymes) to evaluate the effects of the Paleogene paleogeography of Patagonia and more recent climatic oscillations of the Neogene on such cold-tolerant species' genetic makeup. Phylogeographic analysis on sequences of three cpDNA non-coding regions at 85 populations yielded two latitudinally disjunct monophyletic clades north and south of c. 42 degrees S containing 11 and three haplotypes, respectively. This indicates a long-lasting vicariant event due to the presence of an extended open paleobasin at mid latitudes of Patagonia. Also distribution patterns of cpDNA haplotypes suggest regional spread following stepping-stone models using pre-Cenozoic mountains as corridors. Comparable genetic diversity measured along 41 sampled populations using seven polymorphic isozyme loci provides evidence of local persistence and spread from multiple ice-free locations. In addition, significantly higher heterozygosity and allelic richness at high latitudes, i.e. in areas of larger glacial extent, suggest survival in large and isolated refugia. While, higher cpDNA diversity in lower latitudes reflects the complex orogeny that historically isolated northern populations, lower isozyme diversity and reduced F(ST) values provide evidence of local glacial survival in numerous small locales. Therefore, current genetic structure of N. pumilio is the result of regional processes which took place during the Tertiary that were enhanced by contemporary local effects of drift and isolation in response to Quaternary climatic cycles."

        "Abstract": "In this paper we describe a novel approach that may shed light on the genomic DNA methylation of organisms with non-resolved genomes. The LUminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA) is permissive for genomic DNA methylation studies of any genome as it relies on the use of methyl-sensitive and -insensitive restriction enzymes followed by polymerase extension via Pyrosequencing technology. Here, LUMA was used to characterize genomic DNA methylation in the lower brain stem region from 47 polar bears subsistence hunted in central East Greenland between 1999 and 2001. In these samples, average genomic DNA methylation was 57.9% +/- 6.69 (SD; range was 42.0 to 72.4%). When genomic DNA methylation was related to brain mercury (Hg) exposure levels, an inverse association was seen between these two variables for the entire study population (P for trend = 0.17). After dichotomizing animals by gender and controlling for age, a negative trend was seen amongst male animals (P for trend = 0.07) but no associations were found in female bears. Such sexually dimorphic responses have been found in other toxicological studies. Our results show that genomic DNA methylation can be quantitatively studied in a highly reproducible manner in tissue samples from a wild organism with a non-resolved genome. As such, LUMA holds great promise as a novel method to explore consequential questions across the ecological sciences that may require an epigenetic understanding."

        "Abstract": "Pleistocene climate fluctuations have shaped the patterns of genetic diversity observed in extant species. In contrast to Europe and North America where the effects of recent glacial cycles on genetic diversity have been well studied, the genetic legacy of the Pleistocene for the Qinghai-Tibetan (Tibetan) plateau, a region where glaciation was not synchronous with the North Hemisphere ice sheet maxima, remains poorly understood. Here, we compared the phylogeographical patterns of five avian species on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau by three mitochondrial DNA fragments: the Tibetan snow finch (Montifringilla adamsi), the Blanford's snow finch (Pyrgilauda blanfordi), the horned lark (Eremophila alpestris), the twite (Carduelis flavirostris) and the black redstart (Phoenicurus ochruros). Our results revealed the three species mostly distributed on the platform region of the plateau that experienced population expansion following the retreat of the extensive glaciation period (0.5-0.175 Ma). These results are at odds with the results from avian species of Europe and North America, where population expansions occurred after Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 0.023-0.018 Ma). A single refugium was identified in a restricted semi-continuous area around the eastern margin of the plateau, instead of multiple independent refugia for European and North American species. For the other two species distributed on the edges of the plateau (the twite and black redstart), populations were maintained at stable levels. Edge areas are located on the eastern margin, which might have had little or no ice cover during the glaciation period. Thus, milder climate may have mitigated demographic stresses for edge species relative to the extremes experienced by platform counterparts, the present-day ranges of which were heavily ice covered during the glaciation period. Finally, various behavioural and ecological characteristics, including dispersal capacities, habitat preference and altitude specificity along with evolutionary history might have helped to shape different phylogeographical structures appearing in these five species."

        "Abstract": "Understanding the evolution of sex and recombination, key factors in the evolution of life, is a major challenge in biology. Studies of reproduction strategies of natural populations are important to complement the theoretical and experimental models. Fungi with both sexual and asexual life cycles are an interesting system for understanding the evolution of sex. In a study of natural populations of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we found that the isolates are heterothallic, meaning their mating type is stable, while the general belief is that natural S. cerevisiae strains are homothallic (can undergo mating-type switching). Mating-type switching is a gene-conversion process initiated by a site-specific endonuclease HO; this process can be followed by mother-daughter mating. Heterothallic yeast can mate with unrelated haploids (amphimixis), or undergo mating between spores from the same tetrad (intratetrad mating, or automixis), but cannot undergo mother-daughter mating as homothallic yeasts can. Sequence analysis of HO gene in a panel of natural S. cerevisiae isolates revealed multiple mutations. Good correspondence was found in the comparison of population structure characterized using 19 microsatellite markers spread over eight chromosomes and the HO sequence. Experiments that tested whether the mating-type switching pathway upstream and downstream of HO is functional, together with the detected HO mutations, strongly suggest that loss of function of HO is the cause of heterothallism. Furthermore, our results support the hypothesis that clonal reproduction and intratetrad mating may predominate in natural yeast populations, while mother-daughter mating might not be as significant as was considered."

        "Abstract": "During oilseed embryo development, carbon from sucrose is utilized for fatty acid synthesis in the plastid. The role of plastidial glycolysis in Arabidopsis embryo oil accumulation was investigated. Genes encoding enolases (ENO) and phosphoglyceromutases (PGlyM) were identified, and activities and subcellular locations were established by expression of recombinant and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fusion proteins. Mutant Arabidopsis plants lacking putative plastidial isoforms were characterized with respect to isoform composition and embryo oil content. In the developing embryo, ENO1 and ENO2 account for most or all of the plastidial and cytosolic ENO activity, respectively, and PGLYM1 accounts for most or all of the plastidial PGlyM activity. The eno1 and pglym1 mutants, in which plastidic ENO and PGlyM activities were undetectable, had wild-type amounts of seed oil at maturity. It is concluded that although plastids of developing Arabidopsis embryos have the capacity to carry out the lower part of the glycolytic pathway, the cytosolic glycolytic pathway alone is sufficient to support the flux from 3-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate required for oil production. The results highlight the importance for oil production of translocators that facilitate interchange of glycolytic intermediates between the cytosol and the plastid stroma."

The extended-release formulations cost more than double the immediate release prices. For the analgesics studied, drug coverage lowered out-of-pocket prices by 50-85%, while market prices increased at a rate of 5.7-9% per year with little regional variation. Data did not include prices for medications not prescribed or prescribed, but not acquired.Conclusions:Independent of the diagnosis, patients' out-of-pocket price for prescribed analgesics fluctuated freely in the United States across time, region, and coverage status. These fluctuations potentially distort the delivery of effective pain management and further burden an already afflicted population."

Although their role in the management of chronic pain not related to cancer is controversial, there is increasing evidence for their benefit in certain patient populations.Design:A 32-item survey to assess Wisconsin physicians' knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes toward opioid analgesic use was mailed to 600 randomly selected licensed physicians, resulting in a 36% response rate.Results:Half of the respondents considered diversion a moderate or severe problem in Wisconsin. A majority considered addiction to be a combination of physiological and behavioral characteristics, rather than defining it solely as a behavioral syndrome. Most physicians felt it lawful and acceptable medical practice to prescribe opioids for chronic cancer pain, but only half held this view if the pain was not related to cancer. Fewer physicians considered such prescribing as lawful and generally accepted medical practice if the patient had a history of substance abuse. About two-thirds of physicians were not concerned about being investigated for their opioid prescribing practices, but some admitted that fear of investigation led them to lower the dose prescribed, limit the number of refills, or prescribe a Schedule III or IV rather than a Schedule II opioid.Conclusion:Wisconsin physicians who responded to this survey held many misconceptions about the prescribing of opioids. Such views, coupled with a lack of knowledge about laws and regulations governing the prescribing of controlled substances, may result in inadequate prescribing of opioids with resultant inadequate management of pain."

Participants included 241 male and 249 female primary care patients with moderately severe persistent pain of the back, hip, or knee. Multivariable log-linear models were used to determine the association between sex and pain-related disability and whether sex differences persisted after adjustment for psychiatric comorbidity and potential psychological mediators.Results:Compared with men, women reported worse pain intensity, greater pain-related interference with function, and more disability days due to pain. They also had worse depression, anxiety, and self-efficacy. Sex differences in pain interference with function and pain disability days remained significant in multivariable models. Depression, poor self-efficacy, and fear of reinjury were independently associated with disability in both men and women.Conclusions:Women report greater pain-related disability than do men, even after controlling for depression, anxiety, and other psychological factors. Pain management strategies that target functional disability may be particularly important in the treatment of women with pain."

In this study, we report the predictors of pain intensity and activity interference in primary care patients with co-morbid pain and depression.Methods:This is a secondary data analysis of the 250 persons who participated in a randomized clinical trial designed to test the effectiveness of 12 weeks of optimized antidepressant therapy for both depression and pain. Using multivariate linear regression analysis, we assessed the predictive value of baseline self-efficacy, fear of movement, pain beliefs, and demographic and clinical factors on 3-month Graded Chronic Pain Scale pain intensity and activity interference outcomes.Results:In the full model, significant sociodemographic predictors of less activity interference included being non-white (beta-5.8, P = 0.04) and being employed (beta-13.3, P < 0.0001). The latter was also predictive of less pain intensity (beta-5.6, P = 0.01). As expected, the optimized antidepressant treatment arm was associated with improved outcomes (pain intensity: beta-3.7, P = 0.0005 and activity interference: beta-6.4, P = 0.01). Whereas stronger perceived pain control (beta 3.6, P = 0.01) was associated with greater activity interference, higher degree of fear of movement (or fear avoidance) predicted greater pain intensity (beta 0.46, P = 0.04) and activity interference (beta 0.57, P = 0.05). Neither the location (low back vs hip/knee) nor duration of pain were predictive of pain intensity or interference outcomes.Conclusion:The findings are consistent with a bio-psychosocial model, implicating the need to consider the impact of sociodemographic variables and pain-related beliefs and cognition on pain-related outcomes for patients with co-morbid musculoskeletal pain and depression."

Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate the use of Quetiapine (QTP) in the preventive treatment of refractory migraine, defined as previous unresponsiveness to the combination of atenolol, nortriptyline, and flunarizine.Methods:Thirty-four consecutive patients (30 women and 4 men) with migraine (ICHD-II), fewer than 15 days of headache per month, and not overusing symptomatic medications were studied. All participants had failed to the combination of atenolol (60 mg/day), nortriptyline (25 mg/day), and flunarizine (3 mg/day). Failure was defined as <50% reduction in attack frequency after 10 weeks of treatment. After other medications were discontinued, QTP was initiated at a single daily dose of 25 mg, and then titrated to 75 mg. After 10 weeks, headache frequency, consumption of rescue medications, and adverse events were analyzed.Results:Twenty-nine patients completed the study. Three patients withdrew and two were lost to follow-up. Among those who completed, 22 (75.9%; 64.7% of the intention-to-treat population) had greater than 50% headache reduction. The mean frequency of migraine days decreased from 10.2 to 6.2 per month. Use of rescue medications decreased from 2.3 to 1.2 days/week. Adverse events were reported by nine (31%) patients.Conclusions:Although limited by the open design, this study provides pilot data to support the use of QTP in the preventive treatment of refractory migraine. Controlled studies are necessary to confirm these observations."

Strong trends for a positive association with outcome were found for the use of computed tomography (vs fluoroscopy), and using <20 mL of local anesthetic for the diagnostic block.Conclusions:Celiac plexus neurolysis may provide intermediate pain relief to a significant percentage of cancer sufferers. Both careful selection of candidates based on clinical variables, and technical factors aimed at enhancing the specificity of blocks may lead to improved outcomes."

Additional beneficial effects were also maintained, as indicated by the PGIC and FIQ. Patients initially assigned to either placebo or milnacipran 100 mg/day in the lead-in study and subsequently re-randomized to milnacipran 200 mg/day in the extension study experienced further improvements in their mean pain scores, FIQ total scores, and PGIC ratings at 1 year. Milnacipran treatment was generally well tolerated.

We looked at benefits and side effects of therapy, and compared our process of opioid prescription with the practice guidelines defined in adult literature.Design:Descriptive retrospective practice survey.Setting:Multidisciplinary pain clinic in a tertiary pediatric hospital.Patients:During a 12-month period, 104 patients were seen in the clinic, of which 49 received an opioid as part of their pain management; 11 received an opioid chronically, defined as more than 3 months in this study, and 5 of these were still on opioid at the end of the study period although data on one patient are lacking as she had been transferred to an adult clinic.Methods:Information about patients was obtained from chart review.Outcome measures:Benefits and side effects of treatment, as well as the process of prescribing opioids and follow-up.Results:In the four patients studied, there seem to be better pain control and improved function in these patients while on opioid therapy, despite minor side effects. We identified some areas of improvement in our practice and made recommendations for the use of opioids in pediatric chronic severe nonmalignant pain.Conclusions:The evolution of our four patients seems to be in favor of treatment with an opioid for severe chronic nonmalignant pain in certain pediatric patients, in the context of prescribing in a multidisciplinary pain clinic with a multisystem approach to pain management although more data are needed to know if such therapy is safe and beneficial on a longer-term basis."

Was this a chance occurrence, or could there be any link between the two conditions? Did the pain itself and the persistent inflammatory and immunological response to pain contribute to the development of malignancy, or could the malignancy have been present subclinically for many years and have contributed to the ongoing pain syndrome? This case report looks into the diagnosis of synovial sarcoma and CRPS and the relationship between the neurogenic inflammation seen in CRPS and that seen in malignancies. The diagnosis of CRPS is a diagnosis of exclusion. Constant vigilance of patients with this unpleasant condition is necessary."

The diagnosis of \"Muscle Pain Amenable to Injection\" (MPAI), rather than trigger points, was made if pain was produced for the duration of the stimulation. If MPAI was found, muscle tendon injections (MTI) were offered to patients along with post-MTI physical therapy, providing neuromuscular electrical stimulation followed by a validated exercise program [1]. A control group, evaluated 1 month prior to their actual consultation/evaluation when muscle pain was identified but not yet treated, was used for comparison.Results:Forty-five patients who met criteria completed treatment. Patients' scores on the Brief Pain Inventory decreased an average of 62%; median 70% (P < 0.001) for pain severity and 68%; median 85% (P < 0.001) for pain interference one month following treatment. These changes were significantly greater (P < 0.001) than those observed in the untreated controls.Conclusion:A protocol incorporating an easily reproducible electrical stimulus to diagnose a muscle causing pain in a region of the body followed by an injection technique that involves the entirety of the muscle, and post injection restoration of muscle function, can successfully eliminate or significantly reduce regional pain present for years."

In both species, enhanced UV-B radiation significantly increased UV-B absorbing compounds and guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) activity, while no significant effects were observed in photosynthetic pigments and proline content. On the other hand, cuttings grown with high-nutrient availability had larger leaf area, higher total biomass and GPX activity as well as higher water use efficiency (WUE) (as measured by stable carbon isotope composition, delta(13)C) when compared with low-nutrient conditions, while UV-B absorbing compounds and ascorbic acid (AsA) content significantly decreased. Differences in responses to enhanced UV-B radiation and nutrient availability were observed between the two species. Nutrient-induced increases in chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll as well as in carotenoids were greater in P. kangdingensis than in P. cathayana. In P. cathayana, enhanced UV-B radiation significantly decreased leaf area and total biomass, while it significantly increased WUE and ascorbate peroxidase (APX). In contrast, such changes were not observed in P. kangdingensis. In addition, the effects of enhanced UV-B radiation on leaf area, total biomass and UV-B absorbing compounds were closely related to the nutrient status. Our results indicated that P. kangdingensis, which originates from the altitude of 3500 m and is apparently adapted to low-nutrient and high-UV-B habitats, exhibits better tolerance to enhanced UV-B radiation and greater growth under low-nutrient availability than does P. cathayana originating from the altitude of 1500 m."

        "Abstract": "Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a hallmark of successful recognition of infection and activation of plant defenses. ROS play multifaceted signaling functions mediating the establishment of multiple responses and can act as local toxins. Controversy surrounds the origin of these ROS. Several enzymatic mechanisms, among them a plasma membrane NADPH oxidase and cell wall peroxidases, can be responsible for the ROS detected in the apoplast. However, high levels of ROS from metabolic origins and/or from downregulation of ROS-scavenging systems can also accumulate in different compartments of the plant cell. This compartmentalization could contribute to the specific functions attributed to ROS. Additionally, ROS interact with other signals and phytohormones, which could explain the variety of different scenarios where ROS signaling plays an important part. Interestingly, pathogens have developed ways to alter ROS accumulation or signaling to modify plant defenses. Although ROS have been mainly associated with pathogen attack, ROS are also detected in other biotic interactions including beneficial symbiotic interactions with bacteria or mycorrhiza, suggesting that ROS production is a common feature of different biotic interactions. Here, we present a comprehensive review describing the newer views in ROS signaling and function during biotic stress."

We sampled 143 symbionts from 47 native species of Mimosa across 1800 km in central Brazil and found that 98% were Burkholderia. Gene sequences defined seven distinct and divergent species complexes within the genus Burkholderia. The symbiosis-related genes formed deep Burkholderia-specific clades, each specific to a species complex, implying that these genes diverged over a long period within Burkholderia without substantial horizontal gene transfer between species complexes."

        "Abstract": "Coastal plants are ideal models for studying the colonization routes of species because of the simple linear distributions of these species. Carex extensa occurs mainly in salt marshes along the Mediterranean and European coasts. Variation in cpDNA sequences, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and simple sequence repeats (SSRs) of 24 populations were analysed to reconstruct its colonization history. Phylogenetic relationships indicate that C. extensa together with the South American Carex vixdentata and the southern African Carex ecklonii form a monophyletic group of halophilic species. Analyses of divergence times suggest that early lineage diversification may have occurred between the late Miocene and the late Pliocene (Messinian crisis). Phylogenetic and network analyses of cpDNA variation revealed the monophyly of the species and an ancestral haplotype contained in populations of the eastern Mediterranean. The AFLP and SSR analyses support a pattern of variation compatible with these two lineages. These analyses also show higher levels of genetic diversity and differentiation in the eastern population group, which underwent an east-to-west Mediterranean colonization. Quaternary climatic oscillations appear to have been responsible for the split between these two lineages. Secondary contacts may have taken place in areas near the Ligurian Sea in agreement with the gene flow detected in Corsican populations. The AFLP and SSR data accord with the 'tabula rasa' hypothesis in which a recent and rapid colonization of northern Europe took place from the western Mediterranean after the Last Glacial Maximum. The unbalanced west-east vs. west-north colonization may be as a result of 'high density blocking' effect."

Using presumably neutral markers we can assess the time-dependent process of genetic drift, and thereby quantify patterns of differentiation in support of the effective management of diversity. However, adaptive differences can be overlooked in these studies, and these are the very characteristics that we hope to conserve by managing neutral diversity. In this study, we used 16 hypothetically neutral microsatellite markers to investigate the genetic structure of the roundnose grenadier in the North Atlantic. We found that one locus was a clear outlier under directional selection, with F(ST) values much greater than at the remaining loci. Differentiation between populations at this locus was related to depth, suggesting directional selection, presumably acting on a linked locus. Considering only the loci identified as neutral, there remained significant population structure over the region of the North Atlantic studied. In addition to a weak pattern of isolation by distance, we identified a putative barrier to gene flow between sample sites either side of the Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone, which marks the location where the sub-polar front crosses the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This may reflect a boundary across which larvae are differentially distributed in separate current systems to some extent, promoting differentiation by drift. Structure due to both drift and apparent selection should be considered in management policy."

However, traditional methods of monitoring have practical challenges, such as the limited availability of experts and funding. Administrative data including a patient classification system may be employed for risk-adjusted assessment of hospital-wide blood use.Materials and methods:We conducted an audit of blood use at two hospitals and determined proportions of appropriate blood use at each hospital. We then used administrative data of 587,045 cases provided by 73 hospitals to develop two mathematical models to calculate risk-adjusted use of blood products. The first model is a logistic regression model to predict the percentage of transfused patients. Patient demographics, surgery and diagnostic groups were utilized as predictors of transfusion. The second model is a case-mix adjusted model which predicts hospital-wide use of units of blood products from the distribution of diagnosis-related groups. For each model, the observed to expected (O/E) ratio of blood use in each hospital was calculated. We compared resultant ratios with proportions of appropriate blood use in two of the hospitals studied.Results:Both models showed good prediction abilities. O/E ratios calculated using the two models were relevant to proportions of appropriate transfusions.Conclusions:Risk-adjusted assessments of blood product use based on administrative data allow hospital-wide evaluation of transfusion use. Comparing blood use between different hospitals contributes toward establishing appropriate transfusion practices."

Luteal (CL, days 14-16 of the oestrous cycle), steroidogenic cells (LSC) and endothelial cells (LEC) of the bovine corpus luteum (CL), and granulosa cells (GC) were isolated enzymatically, cultured in a monolayer and incubated with LTC(4), LTB(4), Azelastine (an antagonist of LTC(4)) or Dapsone (an antagonist of LTB(4)). Then cells were collected for determination of mRNA expression for LT receptors (LTRs) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) by real time RT-PCR, and media were collected for determination of prostaglandin (PG)E(2), F(2α), progesterone (P4; LSC only), endothelin-1 (ET-1; LEC only) and 17-β oestradiol (E2; GC only). The greatest mRNA expression for LTR-II and 5-LO were found in LEC, whereas LTR-I mRNA expression did not differ among cell types. The level of PGE(2) increased after LTs treatment in each type of ovarian cell, excluding LTC(4) treatment in LEC. The secretion of PGF(2α) was also increased by LTs, but decreased after LTB(4) treatment of LSC. In GC cultures, both LTs stimulated E2 secretion; in LEC cultures, LTB(4) stimulated whereas LTC(4) inhibited P4 secretion; in LEC cultures, LTC(4) stimulated but LTB(4) inhibited ET-1 secretion. The results show that LTs are produced locally and are involved in PGs production/secretion in all examined cells (LSC, LEC and GC) of bovine ovary. Leukotriene treatment modulate secretion of E2, by GC, P4 by LSC and ET-1 by LEC, which indicates that LTs are involved in regulation of ovarian secretory functions."

Twelve cows were supplied with 2000 mg of β-carotene (20 g Rovimix(®) β-Carotene containing 10% β-carotene; DSM Nutrition Japan K.K., Tokyo, Japan) by oral administration daily from day 21 before expected calving date to parturition. Fourteen cows (control) did not receive β-carotene supplementation. Blood samples were obtained on days 21, 14 and 7 before expected calving date and on days 1, 7, 14, 21 postpartum. When the plasma progesterone concentration exceeded 1 ng/ml by day 21 postpartum, luteal activity was assumed to have been initiated. The result showed that serum β-carotene concentrations in the β-carotene cows were higher than in the control cows during the experimental period (p < 0.01). The number of cows with the onset of luteal activity by day 21 postpartum was 9/12 in the β-carotene cows and 4/14 in the control cows (p < 0.05). Retinol, certain metabolic parameters and metabolic hormones concentrations did not differ between β-carotene and control cows. In addition, serum retinol concentration in β-carotene cows without luteal activity was lower than in β-carotene cows with luteal activity (p < 0.05), and serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase concentration in β-carotene cows with luteal activity (p < 0.05) and control cows without luteal activity (p < 0.01) was higher than in control cows with luteal activity. In conclusion, β-carotene supply during the close-up dry period may support the onset of luteal activity during early lactation in dairy cows."

For this purpose, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from two groups of patients with HCV(+) NHL and with or without MC (70 and 71 cases, respectively), and from 4575 blood donors. Eighty-three subjects with HCV infection only, and 118 patients with MC, only without lymphoma, were added as additional control groups. Individual HLA-DR and -DQ alleles were determined using high-resolution sequence-based typing and then data were collected by considering the HLA-DRB1 and DQB1 supertypes on the basis of common structural and functional features, proposed by in silico Bioinformatic studies. From the data, it is evidenced that the DR5-DQ3 HLA combination was strongly associated with the HCV (+) MC (+) NHL group of patients compared with bone marrow donor population (P<or= 0.001, RR = 2.498), while the contribution of DR1-DQ1 was higher in HCV (+) NHL without MC (P<or= 0.001, RR = 2.519). Thus, cryoglobulinemia clinical manifestation was found to be correlated with the preferential use of HLA DR-DQ combination in HCV-associated NHL.

In this contribution, we briefly outline the major steps from the discovery of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-class I-specific inhibitory receptors in humans to recent successful clinical applications in the cure of high-risk leukemias both in adults and in pediatric patients. A central role is played by 'alloreactive' NK cells originated from donor's CD 34(+) cells in eradicating leukemic cells in the setting of T-cell-depleted haploidentical hemopoietic stem cell transplantation. Because alloreactive NK cells play a central role also in preventing graft rejection and graft-vs-host disease, they may represent an ideal tool to treat patients affected by acute high-risk leukemias."

        "Abstract": "Alternaria species are members of a heterogeneous group of dematiaceous fungi that rarely cause opportunistic infections in transplant recipients. During a 20-year period from 1989 to 2008, 8 solid organ transplant recipients (63% males; median age, 48 years) developed Alternaria species infections at the Mayo Clinic. All patients were highly immunocompromised as evidenced by their receipt of multiple transplants, treatment of acute and chronic allograft rejection, and occurrence of other opportunistic infections. All patients presented with non-tender erythematous or violaceous skin papules, nodules, or pustules in exposed areas of the extremities. No case of visceral dissemination was observed. Itraconazole was the most common drug used for treatment, although voriconazole, posaconazole, and caspofungin could potentially be useful based on our limited clinical data and in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing. One patient was treated with voriconazole, while another patient who was refractory to itraconazole had rapid resolution of lesions after the addition of caspofungin. Attempts at antifungal therapy alone were unsuccessful; all patients eventually required surgical excision of lesions. In conclusion, Alternaria species are rare but increasingly recognized opportunistic infections among highly immunocompromised transplant recipients. Wide excisional surgery combined with prolonged systemic antifungal therapy and reduction in immunosuppressive regimens provided the best chance of cure. Although itraconazole remains the most common drug for treatment, this case series highlights the potential clinical utility of caspofungin, voriconazole, and posaconazole as alternative regimens."

        "Abstract": "Oral (p.o.) or intravenous (IV) ganciclovir (GCV) has been the first-line agent for prevention and treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease in solid organ transplantation (SOT). The introduction of p.o. valganciclovir, with higher bioavailability than p.o. GCV, has proven to be a suitable approach toward outpatient p.o. therapy for CMV infection/disease. The present single-arm, exploratory pilot trial performed with 21 patients investigates the efficacy and safety of a short therapeutic course (21 days) based on an initial IV treatment with GCV (5 mg/kg twice daily, for 5 days) followed by p.o. valganciclovir (900 mg twice daily, for 16 days) for CMV infection/disease in SOT patients. In all cases, doses were adjusted for renal function. Moreover, the study allowed comparison of exposure to GCV after p.o. valganciclovir with respect to IV GCV in the same patients. Response to treatment was monitored until day 180. Viral load eradication was achieved in 66.7% of patients, on day 21. Although not statistically significant, a trend was seen toward increased persistence of viral load on day 21 for patients with donor positive/recipient negative CMV serostatus or receiving either anti-rejection therapy or polyclonal anti-thymocyte globulin. CMV clinical infection recurred in 14.3% of patients, with higher recurrence rates in patients with risk factors for persistence of viremia. Exposures to GCV after using IV GCV or p.o. valganciclovir showed comparable values (P=0.054). This short course, combining initial IV GCV and subsequent p.o. valganciclovir, may provide effective exposure and therapeutic response in the treatment of CMV infection in SOT patients with adequate drug exposure and with the additional potential benefit of shortening the length of hospital stay, which may result in cost reduction and improved patient comfort."

        "Abstract": "Background:Organ transplantation places patients at risk for tuberculosis (TB), which constitutes a challenge to physicians due to its atypical and extrapulmonary presentations, complicated treatment issues, and high morbidity and mortality.Methods:We identified all patients with TB following solid organ transplantation at a large university medical center in New York. Demographic data, transplant characteristics (type of organ and donor), underlying medical conditions, immunosuppressive drugs, rejection and opportunistic infections were analyzed, and a nested case-control study was performed to identify factors associated with the development of TB.Results:From 1988 to 2007, 4925 transplants were performed at Columbia University Medical Center: 1858 kidney, 857 liver, 1714 heart, 460 lung, and 36 heart/lung. Thirteen patients developed TB, for a cumulative incidence of 264/100,000. Of the 13 patients who developed TB, 10 had a kidney transplant, 2 had a lung transplant, and 1 had a heart transplant. The median time to develop TB was 11.2 (interquartile ratio: 4.4-23.0) months following transplantation. These cases were compared with 52 randomly selected control patients who had transplants not complicated by TB. Patients with TB were more likely to be renal transplant recipients (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 4.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-19.67) and to be non-Caucasians (adjusted OR: 3.94; 95% CI: 0.99-15.56) than controls.Conclusions:The incidence of TB in post-transplant patients is much higher than the overall background incidence in the United States. Non-Caucasian and kidney transplant recipients appear to be at increased risk of developing TB. This may be associated with prior exposure to TB before transplant in these populations."

All those testing positive (220) and a random sample of negatives (555) were retested in the field with the new format (CATT-D10). Inter-format reproducibility was assessed by calculating kappa. All samples testing positive on whole blood with either method were further evaluated in Belgium by CATT titration of serum by two observers, using both old and new format. CATT-D10 test kits were incubated under four temperature regimens (4, 37, 45 degrees C and fluctuating) with regular assessments of reactivity over 18 months.Results:Inter-format reproducibility of CATT-D10 vs. CATT-R250 on whole blood performed by laboratory technicians in the field was excellent with kappa values of 0.83-0.89. Both inter- and intra-format reproducibility assessed by CATT titration were excellent, with 96.5-100% of all differences observed falling within the limits of +/-1 titration step. After 18 months, reactivity of test kits incubated under all four temperature regimens was still well above the minimum threshold considered acceptable.Conclusion:The CATT-D10 is thermostable and can be used interchangeably with the old format of the CATT test. It is highly suitable for use in peripheral health facilities in HAT-endemic countries."

There was no statistical difference between the areas that did and did not receive the educational campaign. The most common barriers to adherence were fear of medication side effects (47.4%) and lack of recognition of one's risk for LF (15.8%). Modifiable, statistically significant, multivariable predictors of adherence were knowing that DEC prevents LF (aOR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.4-5.1), knowing that mosquitoes transmit LF (aOR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1-3.2), and knowing both about the mass drug administration (MDA) in advance and that mosquitoes transmit LF (aOR = 5.4, 95% CI: 2.8-10.4).Conclusions:India needs to increase compliance with MDA programmes to reach its goal of interrupting LF transmission. Promoting a simple public health message before MDA distribution, which takes into account barriers to and predictors of adherence, could raise compliance with the LF MDA programme."

A total of 288 in 2004, 357 in 2005 and 348 in 2006 distributors were interviewed in Cameroon, and 706, 618 and 789 in Uganda, respectively. The questions included treatment coverage, involvement in additional activities, where and for how long these activities were provided, and whether they were supervised.Results:At least 70% of the distributors in Cameroon and Uganda during the study period were involved in CDTI and additional health activities. More of the distributors involved in CDTI alone attained 90% treatment coverage than those who had CDTI with additional health activities. The more the additional activities, the less likely the distributors were to attain 90% treatment coverage. In Uganda, distributors were more likely to attain 90% coverage (P < 0.001 if they worked within 1 km of their homesteads were selected by community members, worked among kindred, and were responsible for <20 households.Conclusion:Additional activities could potentially undermine the performance of distributors. However, being selected by their community members, working largely among kindred and serving fewer households improved their effectiveness."

Requirements of GAVI for sector oversight and coordination, and the management of the application process through the Ministry of Health's Planning Department, resulted in strong alignment with government policy and planning processes and good levels of stakeholder inclusion and local technical support (TS).Conclusion:Health Systems Strengthening initiatives for global health partnerships (GHPs) can provide a link between the programmatic and the systemic, influencing policy alignment and harmonization of processes. The applications strengthened in-country coordination and planning, with countries using existing health sector assessments to identify system constraints, and to propose. Analyses also produced evidence of broad stakeholder inclusiveness, a good degree of proposal alignment with national health plans and policy documents, and engagement of a largely domestic TS network. While the effectiveness of the proposed interventions cannot be determined from this data, the findings provide support for the GAVI-HSS initiative as implementation continues and evaluation begins."

        "Abstract": "With non-communicable diseases (NCDs) projected to become leading causes of morbidity and mortality in developing countries, research is needed to improve the primary care response, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. This region has a particularly high double burden of communicable diseases and NCDs and the least resources for an effective response. There is a lack of good quality epidemiological data from diverse settings on chronic NCD burden in sub-Saharan Africa, and the approach to primary care of people with chronic NCDs is currently often unstructured. The main primary care research needs are therefore firstly, epidemiological research to document the burden of chronic NCDs, and secondly, health system research to deliver the structured, programmatic, public health approach that has been proposed for the primary care of people with chronic NCDs. Documentation of the burden and trends of chronic NCDs and associated risk factors in different settings and different population groups is needed to enable health system planning for an improved primary care response. Key research issues in implementing the programmatic framework for an improved primary care response are how to (i) integrate screening and prevention within health delivery; (ii) validate the use of standard diagnostic protocols for NCD case-finding among patients presenting to the local health facilities; (iii) improve the procurement and provision of standardised treatment and (iv) develop and implement a data collection system for standardised monitoring and evaluation of patient outcomes. Important research considerations include the following: selection of research sites and the particular NCDs targeted; research methodology; local research capacity; research collaborations; ethical issues; translating research findings into policy and practice and funding. Meeting the research needs for an improved health system response is crucial to deliver effective, affordable and equitable care for the millions of people with chronic NCDs in developing countries in Africa."

These disorders were more pronounced in patients who died eventually. PT prolongation was associated with mortality (OR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0-1.8, P = 0.04). Bleeding occurred in 31 subjects (60%). Of these, 24 had mild bleeding and seven had severe haemorrhages. Thrombocytopenia (platelets </=100 x 10(9)/l) was significantly associated with clinical bleeding (OR 4.6, 95% CI: 1.3-16). A subanalysis of patients with and without severe bleeding revealed a more pronounced imbalance of the coagulation system in patients with severe bleeding, as reflected by a significant association with PT (OR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0-1.8, P = 0.05) and the TAT/PAP ratio (OR 1.3, 95% CI: 1.0-1.6, P = 0.05), which is an indicator of the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis. Overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was found in 10 (22%) of the 46 patients for whom the score could be calculated. There was no significant association between DIC scores, bleeding diathesis or poor outcome.Conclusion:The coagulation system was strongly activated in patients with leptospirosis. This was more pronounced in the deceased and in patients with severe bleeding than in than the survivors and in those without severe bleeding."

This occurred after attacks on the US on September 11, 2001 when many new blood donors lined up to donate. This study was performed to compare return rates for first time donors (FTD) after September 11th, 2001 to FTD during a comparable period in 2000.Materials and methods:A total of 3315 allogeneic whole blood donations from FTD at a regional blood centre were collected between September 11th and 30th, 2001. Subsequent donations by the FTD before March 31, 2002 were reviewed. This (test) group was compared to 1279 FTD (control group) donating during the same time period in September 2000 and to their return rate in the subsequent 6 months.Results:Following September 11, 2001, 1087/3315 (32.8%) FTD returned by March 31, 2002. This return rate was similar to the control group [427/1279 (33.4%)]. The deferral rate during the donor screening process for the control group was significantly higher than the deferral rate for the September 11-30, 2001 group (P < 0.01). The odds of an individual FTD returning increased with age, and the chance of a female donor returning was 1.13 times higher than a male (P = 0.06). There was a carryover effect after September 11, 2001 too.Conclusion:A national emergency, September 11, 2001, inspired people to donate blood for the first time. However, the proportion of return donations amongst them was not increased. Females and males in certain age groups were more likely to become repeat donors due to the residual effect of September 11, 2001. Additional efforts are needed to retain eligible FTD in donor pools."

We also wanted to see whether passive smoking could be a contributory factor.Methods:In a longitudinal study, 33 children who attended the emergency room with an RSV infection (age < or = 7 months) were compared with 37 age-matched controls recruited from routine infant check-ups. The 18-month follow-up consisted of a questionnaire focusing on environmental factors and the child's health during the last 12 months. An allergy skin prick test (SPT) was performed and venous blood was obtained.Results:The prevalence of AOM and the use of antibiotics were higher in the RSV group than in the controls (p = 0.009 and p = 0.027 respectively). The number of AOMs and the use of antibiotics correlated, r = 0.8. In the RSV group, one or both parents smoked in 52% compared with 14% in the controls (p < 0.001). There were no differences in allergy SPT results.Conclusion:The infants with RSV infection had AOM and were prescribed antibiotics more frequently during the follow-up period. Furthermore, smoking was far more common among the parents of the RSV group. We speculate that passive smoking could be a contributory factor to the infections noted here."

A cluster was defined as having high BMI and > or = 2 other risk factors.Results:The counselling did not reduce the prevalence of overweight in 5- to 15-year-old participants. From age 7 onwards, the proportion of children with > or = 2 risk factors was lower in the intervention than in the control group (p = 0.005). At the age of 15 years, 13.0% of girls and 10.8% of boys in the intervention group and 17.5% of girls and 18.8% of boys in the control group had the risk factor cluster (p = 0.046 for main effect of the study group). Having even one risk factor at the age of 5 years predicted the clustering of risk factors at the age of 15 years (OR: 3.8, p < 0.001).Conclusion:Repeated, individualized dietary and lifestyle counselling may reduce the clustering of overweight-related cardiometabolic risk factors in adolescents even though the counselling is not intense enough to prevent overweight."

Each child's behaviour was observed by a parent or a caregiver and by a physiotherapist in two calm and two painful situations within the child's everyday life. The raters independently assessed and graded the child's behaviour during 5 min according to the translated Swedish version of the NCCPC-PV. The intrarater and interrater reliability were determined, and the construct validity was examined.Results:The results from 202 assessments showed that the construct validity was good: children's behavioural signs differed significantly between situations of pain and situations of calm (p < 0.001). Repeated assessments showed poor agreement both within and between raters [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.51-0.65]. The agreement for pain was good (ICC 0.83).Conclusion:The Swedish version of the NCCPC-PV can be used for pain assessment in children with cognitive impairments who lack verbal communication. Aspects of reliability need to be further analysed."

We tested if single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL4R gene were associated with susceptibility to such diseases, or if they were related to the phenotypic presentation of asthma and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC).Methods:Three hundred and nine 12- to 13-year-old children were included. Six SNPs in the IL4R were analysed in response to current allergic disease, and to presentation of specific asthma and ARC phenotypes. Questionnaires were used to determine allergic disease status, and skin prick tests to evaluate sensitization to common airborne allergens.Results:Less eczema was seen in individuals with the AA-genotype of rs2057768, and less ARC among those with the AA-genotype of rs2107356, especially ARC associated with sensitization to pollen. The AA-genotype of rs2057768 and the TT genotype of rs3024632 were associated with a specific asthma phenotype.Conclusion:Variations within the IL4R gene are associated with allergic diseases in children, preferably with eczema and disease phenotypes of ARC and asthma."

        "Abstract": "The amyloid cascade hypothesis, based on the genetic data from early onset, familial forms of the disease, has been the dominant model for many years and involves over production and deposition of the beta amyloid protein as causal in the disease process. However, it does not apply very well to the more common, later onset, sporadic form of the disease, where a wider range of factors appear to be involved in disease progression. Over recent years, data illustrating reciprocal interactions between the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its various metabolites with many factors involved in normal synaptic plasticity have emerged. These feedback relationships have the potential to affect the complex kinase cascades involved in every aspect of neuronal function. Further, data regarding the multiple roles of the presenilins have the potential to allow the over expression and deposition of the amyloid beta protein to be both a cause and consequence of disease progression, with relevance in both sporadic and familial of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Disease progression might be better explained by a chaotic matrix of factors and raises the question again whether AD should be approached as a single entity or as a syndrome, with important consequences for disease identification and treatment."

All data were collected by interview including the question on orthodontic treatment. Other data used in our study were family social status and income, maternal educational attainment and place of birth, whether the child was covered by a supplementary health insurance and whether the residence was urban or rural. We also calculated the density of orthodontists in the district. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to study the relationships between these social and economic factors and orthodontic treatment.Results:The prevalence of orthodontic treatment was 14% of all children aged 8-18, 15% for girls, and 13% for boys, and 23% in the 12 to 15-year age group. Children were less likely to have orthodontic treatment when parents were service or sales workers compared with children whose parents were managers or professionals (aOR = 0.50; 95%CI: [0.34;0.76]), when family income was in the lowest, compared with highest quartile (aOR = 0,62; 95% CI: [0.45;0.85]), when children had no supplementary insurance compared with children covered by private insurance (aOR = 0.53; 95% CI: [0.34; 0.81]), or when they lived in rural compared with urban areas (aOR = 0.70; 95% CI: [0.54; 0.91]).Conclusion:There are social inequalities in orthodontic treatment in France, associated mainly with social status, annual income, supplementary insurance, and the residence area."

Only limited data are available on the clinical consequences of untreated dental caries because there is no measure to quantify the prevalence and severity of oral conditions resulting from untreated dental caries.Objectives:To present a new index to evaluate the prevalence and severity of oral conditions resulting from untreated dental caries. To validate the index within the Philippines National Oral Health Survey, 2006.Methods:The PUFA index records the presence of severely decayed teeth with visible pulpal involvement (P/p), ulceration caused by dislocated tooth fragments (U/u), fistula (F/f) and abscess (A/a).Results:Good kappa values show the reliability of the index. The prevalence of PUFA/pufa >0 was 85% and 56% for 6- and 12-year-olds, respectively. The mean number of teeth affected (PUFA/pufa) was 3.5 and 1.2 for 6- and 12-year-olds, respectively. In 6- and 12-year-olds, 40% and 41% of decayed teeth had progressed to odontogenic infections.Conclusion:The PUFA index complements classical caries indices with relevant information for epidemiologists and health care planners."

However, no comprehensive review article summarizing the studies investigating this issue has been published.Objective:To assess the relationships between perceptions of dental appearance/oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and dental fluorosis.Methods:The PubMed database was searched using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) for English-language studies from 1985 to March 2009. Thirty-five articles qualified for inclusion and then were classified into three categories based on the type of study approach: (i) respondent review of photographs and assessment concerning satisfaction/acceptance, (ii) respondent assessment of study subject's teeth concerning satisfaction/acceptance, and (iii) respondent assessments of the psychosocial/OHRQoL impact.Results:There were varied results from earlier studies focused on satisfaction/acceptance of very mild to mild fluorosis. More recent studies with methodological improvements to assess impact on quality of life clearly showed that mild fluorosis was not a concern. Furthermore, mild fluorosis was sometimes associated with improved OHRQoL. Severe fluorosis was consistently reported to have negative effects on OHRQoL.Conclusion:Because dental fluorosis in the United States and other nations without high levels of naturally-occurring fluoride is mild or very mild, with little impact on OHRQoL, dental professionals should emphasize the appropriate use of fluorides for caries prevention and preventing moderate/severe fluorosis."

Evidence indicates that proceeding with orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in patients diagnosed with severe PPHN (mean pulmonary artery pressure [mPAP]>45 mmHg) at the time of OLT surgery is associated with high perioperative mortality. We describe a case of severe PPHN that was diagnosed by right heart catheterization at the time of surgery. We quickly determined the reversibility of PPHN with a bolus of milrinone and proceeded with OLT. Further episodes of pulmonary hypertension were successfully managed with continuous milrinone infusion and transesophageal echocardiography monitoring. Reversibility via vasodilator trial after identification of high pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) may be an important indication of the feasibility of OLT. Milrinone may be useful for the rapid identification of the reversibility of high PAP and may be an effective agent to control abrupt increases in PAP during OLT."

Patients were asked to return for an evaluation after 2 weeks and to complete a self-assessment questionnaire during the follow-up visit.Results:There was more than 50% less pain associated with the dermal gel with lidocaine than with the same filler without lidocaine at all time points (p<.05). The greatest difference in pain was recorded at the time of injection, and then the effect gradually declined over the 60-minute period. Both fillers were well tolerated, and there was no difference in outcome after 2 weeks.Conclusion:Addition of lidocaine to a filler resulted in significantly less pain associated with the procedure without compromising outcomes."

Subjects were masked to needle size. They were then asked to rate injection pain on an 11-point numerical rating scale and to note any bruising. Physician preference was also evaluated.Results:There were no statistically significant differences in the amount of intra-procedural pain (p=.37) or the level of post-procedural pain and discomfort (p=.76) experienced. Twenty-seven percent of subjects reported greater bruising with the 32-gauge needle, versus 29.7% with the 30-gauge needle. The physician injector did not have a preference. Lastly, 83.8% of subjects did not detect a difference in BTX-A paralysis effect.Conclusion:We do not recommend using 32-gauge needles in place of 30-gauge needles for administering BTX-A."

The laser parameters, patient history, and surgical details were recorded.Results:The overall recurrence rate was 13.3%, after a mean follow-up period +/- standard error of the mean of 4.8 +/- 0.3 years. The mean number of laser treatment was 2.7 +/- 0.1. Seventy-five percent of the recurrences were detected after a follow-up period of 5 to 9 years. Fifty percent of the recurrent cases had drainage and secondary intention before the laser epilation.Conclusion:Our results strongly suggest that laser hair removal after surgical interventions in pilonidal sinus disease decreases the risk of recurrence over the long term."

Although many studies report clinical improvement with PDT in photodamaged skin, histologic and morphometric evidence is not documented in most cases.Objective:To evaluate clinical and histopathologic changes induced by methyl aminolevulinate (MAL)-PDT and to morphometrically quantify collagen and elastic fibers in skin remodeling induced by MAL-PDT in photodamaged skin.Methods and materials:Fourteen patients were treated with two sessions of MAL-PDT. The light source was a light-emitting diode: 635 nm, 37 J/cm(2). Skin biopsies were performed before and 3 and 4 months after treatment. All fragments were stained using the hematoxylin-eosin, orcein, and picrosirius techniques. Morphometric studies were done of three samples from each patient.Results:Global clinical improvement was observed in 10 of 14 patients. The histopathologic study showed increased collagen fibers 3 and 6 months after treatment. The decrease in the amount of elastic fiber was statistically significant 3 (p=.016) and 6 (p=.008) months after treatment. The increase in the amount of collagen fiber was statistically significant 6 months after treatment (p=.048).Conclusion:Clinical improvement with regard to texture, firmness, wrinkle depth, skin coloration, and clearance of actinic keratoses was observed. Histopathologic and morphometric studies were consistent with the clinical findings."

Seven and two ablations, respectively, were delivered to each temporal branch and angular nerve.Results:Twenty-nine patients underwent bilateral radiofrequency ablation of temporal branches of the facial nerve and the angular nerves. Abrogation of glabellar furrowing was achieved in 90% of patients. No major adverse events were observed. All patients developed mild to moderate swelling, and nine patients (31%) developed purpura in the treated areas. Sixty-nine percent of patients had effects that lasted 4 months or longer, 41% had effects that lasted 6 months or longer, and 10% had effects lasting longer than 12 months.Conclusion:Radiofrequency ablation of efferent branches of the temporal and angular nerves effectively eliminates corrugator and procerus contraction and concomitant glabellar furrowing."

        "Abstract": "Some participants will get HIV-infected in HIV prevention trials, despite risk reduction measures. The subsequent treatment responsibilities of sponsor-investigators have been widely debated, especially where access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is not available. In this paper, we explore two accounts of beneficence to establish whether they can shed light on sponsor-investigator responsibilities. We find the notion of general beneficence helpful insofar as it clarifies that some beneficent actions will be obligatory where they can be dispensed without scuppering the trial. We find the notion of specific beneficence helpful insofar as it directs investigators to attend to the needs of trial participants; however the range of interventions that could be provided remains unhelpfully broad. We then examine accounts of the investigator-participant relationship to narrow the range of interventions that investigators should provide, concluding that health-care, and HIV infection, are appropriate foci. We conclude that when investigators are able to meet the ART needs of their participants (e.g. referral, assisted referral or direct provision) without sacrificing trial quality, they must do so. However, there is little of this explicit direction to be found in the account of specific beneficence itself, but rather it is found in accounts of the relationship that are compatible with beneficence."

        "Abstract": "Monocyte recruitment and their differentiation into macrophages are both early events in native and accelerated atherosclerosis that follows angioplasty. We have investigated the putative functional role of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) present on rabbit monocytes/macrophages. The impact of periadventitial delivery of an EGFR-specific, blocking monoclonal antibody (ICR62, which inhibits EGF-binding to its receptor) was investigated in a rabbit model of accelerated atherosclerosis induced by a combination of carotid injury and 4 weeks of a 2% cholesterol-diet. Two weeks after the initiation of the diet, a balloon-catheter angioplasty of the left common carotid artery was performed and a collar placed around the injured carotid artery immediately, for the delivery of ICR62 antibody, isotype-matched antibody or saline control. Monocyte/macrophage accumulation, cell proliferation and neointimal thickening were determined 2 weeks after the delivery of the antibodies. The function of the EGFR on rabbit monocytes was also investigated in vitro, using chemotaxis assays. Treatment with ICR62 was associated with a significant reduction in macrophage accumulation and neointimal thickening and a 76% reduction in neointimal area of the vessel wall compared with controls. In vitro ICR62 inhibited macrophage and smooth muscle cell migration towards EGFR ligands including EGF and HB-EGF. These findings suggest that EGFR ligation may be important in the development of early atherosclerotic lesions following balloon-catheter angioplasty, and periadventitial delivery may provide a feasible approach for administration of the inhibitors of EGFR-binding such as ICR62."

We present a case of peripheral T-cell lymphoma occurring with an intradermal melanocytic proliferation. A 63-year-old Caucasian man presented with a 12-cm edematous, erythematous to violaceous, scalp ulceration that had enlarged over six months. Previous biopsies showed reactive changes which were concerning for infection. The last biopsies showed small to intermediate sized, angulated cells with clear cytoplasm within the dermis, with extension into the epidermis. These cells stained positive with markers for CD3, CD45RO and CD43, yet showed decreased expression of pan-T-cell markers CD5 and CD7, and absent expression of CD4, CD8, CD56 and CD57 and EBV. Molecular studies showed a clonal T-cell receptor gamma chain gene rearrangement. The diagnosis was peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified. Another biopsy from an indurated area separate from the ulcer showed scattered, enlarged cells embedded in the same lymphocytic infiltrate. No mitotic figures were identified. These cells stained for S100 and Melan-A, in a partly nested arrangement. This was felt to represent a melanocytic nevus. This case likely represents an extraordinary coincidence of two distinctly different neoplasms."

To identify risk factors associated with candida balanitis.Methods:During a 36-month period, a cross-sectional study was carried out on consecutive men attendees of the STD clinic in Hospital S. João, Porto. Clinical and epidemiological data were recorded. Specimen collection from the glans penis and the coronal sulcus followed two procedures: a cotton tipped swab and the direct impression on the surface of CHROMagar Candida medium. Risk factors were considered singly and in combination through logistic regression models.Results:Among 478 men enrolled, the prevalence of candida colonization was 26.2% and the prevalence of candida balanitis was 18%. Candida colonization was strongly associated with an age above 60 years (OR = 3.375; 95% CI: 1.547-7.362) and with the presence of other cause of balanitis apart from Candida organisms (OR: 2.466; 95% CI: 1.491-4.078). An age above 40 years (OR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.005-4.500), diabetes mellitus (OR: 19.390; 95% CI: 7.789-48.273) and more than ten candida colonies recovered by culture (OR: 9.586; 95% CI: 2.682-34.263) were risk factors for candida balanitis.Conclusions:This study highlights the impact of factors other than sexual behaviours upon the epidemiology of this infection. For both candida colonization and infection, age was an important risk factor. Diabetes mellitus was an independent risk factor for candida balanitis. More than ten colonies recovered from culture are associated with clinical signs and symptoms."

Increasing PASI was linked to increasing CRP and a trend to higher elastase and lactoferrin, suggesting that worsening enhances inflammatory response with neutrophil activation. CRP correlated with PASI, total leucocytes, neutrophils, elastase, lactoferrin and alpha1-antitrypsin. NBUVB and PUVA presented similar effects.Conclusion:We propose CRP as a useful marker of psoriasis severity that could be used to monitor psoriasis and its treatment, and, together with PASI and elastase, could also be used as a global index of severity."

Treatment was performed 4 times at 2-week intervals. Treatment effectiveness was determined using lesion counts, acne severity, patient subjective self-assessments of improvement, and histopathological examinations, which included immunohistochemical staining for transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta).Results:Numbers of total acne lesions decreased following both treatments. For inflammatory lesions such as papules, pustules and nodules, IPL-treated sides showed an earlier and more profound improvement than PDL-treated sides. However, at 8 weeks after the 4th treatment, a rebound aggravation of acne was observed on IPL-treated sides. On the contrary, PDL produced gradual improvements during the treatment sessions and these improvements lasted 8 weeks after the 4th treatment. Non-inflammatory lesions as open and closed comedones also showed improvement following both treatments and PDL-treated sides showed better improvement as the study proceeded. Histopathological examinations showed amelioration in inflammatory reactions and an increase in TGF-beta expression after both treatments, which were more prominent for PDL-treated sides.Conclusion:Both PDL and IPL were found to treat acne effectively, but PDL showed a more sustained effect. TGF-beta might play a key role in the resolution of inflammatory acne lesions."

        "Abstract": "Ozone (O3) is damaging to plants, inducing signalling pathways involving antagonism between jasmonates and ethylene. These pathways mediate O3 responses, particularly to acute exposure, and their manipulation protected several species against acute and chronic O3. We use chronic daily exposure of up to 163 ppb O3, and twice weekly application of up to 320 microg plant(-1) methyl jasmonate (MeJA) to test two hypothesizes: 1) a low rate of MeJA does not affect growth but increases O3 sensitivity; 2) a high rate inhibits growth but reduces O3 sensitivity. Both hypotheses were rejected. Growth declined with increases in both MeJA and O3. MeJA at 40 microg plant(-1) caused no direct effect, and at 160 microg plant(-1) reduced growth similarly at all O3. Neither rate altered O3 sensitivity. These additive responses are not consistent with protection by MeJA in this system. They may reflect inter-specific differences in signalling, since O3 concentrations used here exceeded some reported acute exposures. Alternatively, parallel responses to O3 and MeJA may suggest that O3-induced jasmonates play a developmental role in chronic response but no protective role in the absence of lesions characteristic of acute exposure. MeJA appears useful as a probe of these mechanisms."

The core complex represents a Q(a)Q(b)Q(c)R-SNARE-motif bundle, most certainly assembling in steps. However, to date it is unknown which intermediate SNARE complex observed in vitro also exists in vivo. Here we have applied comparative fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)-studies as a novel approach for studying in intact cells a SNARE interaction involved in synaptic vesicle fusion [catalyzed by syntaxin 1A (Q(a)), SNAP25 (Q(b)/Q(c)) and synaptobrevin 2 (R)]. We find that the Q(b)-SNARE-motif of SNAP25 interacts reversibly with clustered syntaxin. The interaction requires most of the alpha helical Q(b)-SNARE-motif and depends on its position within the molecule. We conclude that a zippered Q(a)Q(b)-SNARE complex represents a short-lived SNARE intermediate in intact cells, most likely providing an initial molecular platform toward membrane fusion."

From 2003 to 2007, 58 DCD-LT were performed in Belgium. Mean procurement total warm ischemia time was 25 +/- 2 min (mean +/- SEM). Mean cold ischemia time was 451 +/- 18 min. Mean follow-up was 23 +/- 2.2 months. Post-transplant peak aspartate aminotransminases was 2241 +/- 338 UI/l. Patient survivals at 1 month, 1 and 3 years, were 91.3%, 83.3% and 66.9% respectively. Graft survivals at 1 month, 1 and 3 years, were 84.4%, 72.4% and 48.8% respectively. Two patients (3.4%) developed primary nonfunction. Regarding the biliary complications, seven grafts (12%) were lost because of intrahepatic cholangiopathy, and 12 other patients (20.6%) developed bile duct stenoses requiring endoscopic and/or surgical management. The rate of symptomatic ischemic biliary lesions for grafts surviving more than 3 months was 38% (19/50). Although DCD organ donors may be a source of viable liver grafts, results were inferior to those obtained with donation after brain death LT in this series. Prognostic criteria have to be developed to improve results of DCD-LT."

Occult HCV infection is described as the presence of detectable HCV RNA in liver or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with undetectable plasma HCV-RNA by conventional PCR assays. We have assessed the persistence of HCV in 26 kidney-transplant patients, followed up for 10.5 years (range 2-16), after HCV elimination while on hemodialysis. If HCV really did persist, arising out of the loss of immune control caused by institution of the regimen of immunosuppressive drugs after kidney transplantation, HCV reactivation would have taken place. Their immunosuppression relied on calcineurin inhibitors (100%), and/or steroids (62%), and/or antimetabolites (94%). An induction therapy, given to 22 patients, relied on rabbit antithymocyte globulin (59%) or anti-IL2-receptor blockers (32%). All patients had undetectable HCV RNA as ascertained by several conventional tests. At the last follow-up, no residual HCV RNA was detected in the five liver biopsies, the 26 plasma, and in the 37 nonstimulated and 24 stimulated PBMCs tested with an ultrasensitive RT-PCR assay (detection limit, 2 IU/ml). No biochemical or virologic relapse was seen during follow-up. The absence of HCV relapse in formerly HCV-infected immunocompromised patients suggests the complete eradication of HCV after its elimination while on dialysis."

        "Abstract": "Background:Itch is a major symptom of allergic skin disease. Acupuncture has been shown to exhibit a significant effect on histamine-induced itch in healthy volunteers. We investigated the effect of acupuncture on type I hypersensitivity itch and skin reaction in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial.Methods:An allergen stimulus (house dust mite or grass pollen skin prick) was applied to 30 patients with atopic eczema before (direct effect) and after (preventive effect) two experimental approaches or control observation: acupuncture at points Quchi and Xuehai [verum acupuncture (VA), dominant side], 'placebo-point' acupuncture (PA, dominant side), no acupuncture (NA). Itch intensity was recorded on a visual analogue scale. After 10 min, wheal and flare size and skin perfusion (via LASER-Doppler) were measured at the stimulus site, and the validated Eppendorf Itch Questionnaire (EIQ) was answered.Results:Mean itch intensity was significantly lower in VA (35.7 +/- 6.4) compared to NA (45.9 +/- 7.8) and PA (40.4 +/- 5.8) regarding the direct effect; and significantly lower in VA (34.3 +/- 7.1) and PA (37.8 +/- 5.6) compared to NA (44.6 +/- 6.2) regarding the preventive effect. In the preventive approach, mean wheal and flare size were significantly smaller in VA (0.38 +/- 0.12 cm(2)/8.1 +/- 2.0 cm(2)) compared to PA (0.54 +/- 0.13 cm(2)/13.5 +/- 2.8 cm(2)) and NA (0.73 +/- 0.28 cm(2)/15.1 +/- 4.1 cm(2)), and mean perfusion in VA (72.4 +/- 10.7) compared to NA (84.1 +/- 10.7). Mean EIQ ratings were significantly lower in VA compared to NA and PA in the treatment approach; and significantly lower in VA and PA compared to NA in the preventive approach.Conclusions:Acupuncture at the correct points showed a significant reduction in type I hypersensitivity itch in patients with atopic eczema. With time the preventive point-specific effect diminished with regard to subjective itch sensation, whereas it increased in suppressing skin-prick reactions."

        "Abstract": "Background:Recent studies performing fiberoptic bronchoscopy in children have improved our understanding of asthma pathophysiology. Eosinophilic, but also neutrophilic, inflammation has been described in asthma, but the relationship with atopy was incompletely investigated. The aim of this study is to examine inflammatory cells and mediators in children with asthma compared to the appropriate controls, i.e. atopic children without asthma and children with no atopy or asthma. Moreover, asthmatic children were analysed separately based on the presence of atopy and stratified by age.Methods:We recruited 191 children undergoing fiberoptic bronchoscopy for appropriate indications: 91 asthmatics (aged 1.4-17 years), 44 atopics without asthma (1.6-17.8 years) and 56 nonasthmatic nonatopic controls (1.4-14 years). In bronchoalveolar lavage, total and differential cell counts and inflammatory mediators, including ECP, eotaxin, IL-8 and TNFalpha, were analysed.Results:Eosinophils and ECP levels were increased in asthmatic children when compared to controls (P = 0.002 and P = 0.01, respectively), but also atopic children without asthma had increased ECP levels compared to controls (P = 0.0001). Among asthmatic children, eosinophils and ECP levels were not different between atopic and nonatopic individuals. Neither neutrophils nor the related mediators (IL-8 and TNFalpha) differed significantly in the three groups. This pattern of inflammation was observed in both preschool and school-aged asthmatic children.Conclusions:This study suggests that markers of eosinophilic, but not neutrophilic inflammation, are increased in asthmatic children and also in atopic children without asthma. Of interest, in asthmatic children, the activation of the eosinophilic response is not solely because of the presence of atopy."

The current therapeutic approach with these aggressive tumours is radical nephrectomy followed by systemic chemotherapy, but the prognosis remains dismal.Materials and methods:The whole-genome expression was analysed in four RMC tumours. We also report a case of metastatic RMC in which a complete response was achieved for 9 months using a TopoII-inhibiting therapy.Results:Expanded whole-genome expression analysis showed increases of TopoII in all cases. There was also overall deregulation of DNA remodelling and repair, and an ontological association between RMC and urothelial carcinoma. Using a TopoII-inhibiting agent, there was a complete response for 9 months in a patient with metastatic RMC.Conclusion:This report provides molecular evidence for the rational use of TopoII inhibitors in the treatment of RMC."

Information about treatments, pathological details, and recurrence and survival status was retrospectively collected from 246 patients. The expected survival according to the nomograms was calculated. The predictive accuracy of the proposed models was calculated by Harrell's concordance indices. To assess the independent prognostic value of the variables proposed by IBCNC and BCRC, stepwise multivariable Cox regressions based on Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) for the different endpoints were used. A best model for prediction was created on the basis of our data.Results:The IBCNC and the BCRC nomograms showed an improvement in the predictive accuracy of recurrence, all-cause and bladder-cancer-specific survival after radical cystectomy of up to 4% compared to Tumour-Node-Metastasis stage-based predictions. According to the calculated AIC values for the different models, all nomograms performed better than the TNM classification.Conclusions:The BCRC and IBCNC nomograms provided accurate predictions when they were applied to an external cohort of patients from low- to intermediate-volume centres. The prediction of recurrence and survival based on the addressed nomograms is better than TNM stage-based prediction. The application of such nomograms can be supported on a sound basis, but further amendments are warranted."

All patients had > or = 5 years of follow-up. The endpoints of initial response to BCG and the time to disease recurrence and progression were correlated with gender using Kaplan-Meier methods and multivariate Cox regression models.Results:Men were significantly more likely to present with high grade (P = 0.003) tumours and with CIS (P < 0.001), while age and clinical stage at presentation were similar between men and women. There was no significant difference in the initial response to BCG by gender, as 593/756 (78.4%) men and 219/265 (82.6%) women had no evidence of disease at 6 months after BCG treatment (P = 0.14). The median time to recurrence after BCG therapy was also similar for men and women (20 vs 21 months, P = 0.51). Likewise, there was no evidence of a significant association between gender and the risk of disease progression after BCG therapy, such that the 5-year estimated freedom from progression was 77% and 82%, respectively, for men and women (P = 0.08). Moreover, on a multivariate analysis controlling for patient age and tumour stage, grade and CIS, gender was not associated with the risk of recurrence (hazard ratio 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.79-1.11; P = 0.44) or progression (1.18, 0.85-1.63; P = 0.33) after BCG. When the outcomes for women treated with BCG were stratified by age <50 years (the median age of menopause in the USA) vs > or = 50 years, again there were no differences in the risk of tumour recurrence (P = 0.95) or progression (P = 0.35).Conclusion:These data suggest that the outcomes of men and women with high risk non-muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma treated with BCG are similar. As such, further studies are required to determine the clinical relevance of preclinical evidence that has suggested a potential role for sex steroids in the pathophysiology of bladder cancer."

Failure after salvage therapy was defined as a PSA level of >0.2 ng/mL. Clinical, pathological and treatment factors were analysed.Results:The clinicopathological characteristics were similar between the RT and ADT groups except that men in the RT group were younger (61.4 vs 65.4 years). After ADT, salvage failed in 10 (13%) after a mean (sd) of 18.5 (4.5) months of treatment, and 6.7 months after salvage failed all patients progressed clinically. After RT, salvage failed in 22 (49%) after 30.7 (5.2) months of response. Upon RT failure, all patients received ADT, after which in three (14%) patients the treatment failed again after 20.1 months of treatment and progressed to CP after 6.5 months, while in the remaining 19 (86%) patients the PSA level remained undetectable for 37.6 (7.7) months. On multivariate analysis, pathological stage (> or =T3b) and Gleason grade 5 disease were independently prognostic of CP.Conclusion:Salvage RT alone and combined with subsequent ADT provided PSA control in most patients, significantly increasing CP-free survival compared with initial ADT. Patients with a short PSA doubling time (<3 months) are at high risk of failed salvage treatment after RT, and initial ADT might be considered. Regardless of salvage method, advanced pathological stage and Gleason grade 5 were factors prognostic of CP."

None received adjuvant/salvage therapy in the absence of BCR. The BCR-free, CSM-free and OS rates were defined using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariable Cox-regression models were used to test the effect of age, preoperative PSA level, neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, pT stage, lymph node status, RP Gleason sum and surgical margin status on BCR.Results:The median follow-up of censored patients was 122, 128, and 132 months for, respectively, BCR-free, CSM-free and OS estimates. The 10-year event-free survival rates for the same endpoints were 60%, 94% and 86%, respectively. Preoperative PSA level, RP Gleason sum, pT stage, lymph node status, and surgical margin status were independent predictors of BCR (all adjusted P < 0.05).Conclusions:This study is the first to evaluate the long-term cancer control outcomes after RP from a European country in the PSA era. Our data indicate that RP provides excellent long-term survival rates in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. Although approximately 40% of patients have BCR after 10 years of follow-up, the CSM rate after 10 years is as low as 6%."

As a primary efficacy outcome variable the achievement of continence after treatment with variable doses of propiverine or oxybutynin was assessed. Weekly UI episodes and daily voiding frequency were evaluated as secondary efficacy outcomes. Tolerability was evaluated by the rate of adverse events, adverse drug reactions caused by antimuscarinics and premature treatment termination.Results:At 16 study centres, 621 children aged 5-14 years with UI due to overactive bladder were enrolled. After anticholinergic treatment (437 propiverine, 184 oxybutynin) continence was achieved in 61.6% and 58.7% of the patients after 186 and 259 days, respectively. There were clinically relevant improvements in voiding frequency across treatment groups. Daily doses of propiverine were markedly below the recommendations (0.54 vs 0.8 mg/kg body weight), daily doses of oxybutynin were according to the recommendations (0.31 vs 0.2-0.4 mg/kg body weight) at treatment initiation. There was a significantly more favourable tolerability to propiverine than oxybutynin for the overall rate of adverse events (3.9% vs 16.3%, odds ratio 4.813), adverse drug reactions caused by propiverine or oxybutynin (2.8% vs 9.2%) and premature treatment termination due to adverse drug reactions (1.6% vs 4.4%).Conclusion:Propiverine and oxybutynin are effective in children with UI due to overactive bladder. Sufficient treatment periods of at least 2, preferably 3-4, months are the crucial factors for a successful treatment. The tolerability profile of propiverine is better than for oxybutynin."

Specimens were evaluated as 13 separate packages from pre-designated anatomical locations. The number of LNs and presence of positive LNs (LN+) at each location was prospectively registered.Results:The median (range) number of LNs removed was 24 (6-62). In all, 25.3% of the patients had LN+. The median (range) number of LN+ was 2 (1-20). Advanced T-stage was correlated with a higher risk of LN+ but not to the specific location of the LN+. Two patients had LN+ above the common iliac bifurcation with no LN+ more distally located within the pelvic region. All other patients with LN+ above the common iliac bifurcation had more distally located LN+. There were no skip lesions to LNs above the aortic bifurcation.Conclusions:Extended LND above the common iliac bifurcation including the presacral area provides a more accurate LN staging compared with a standard pelvic LND. Extending the limits above the aortic bifurcation is not necessary from a staging perspective."

The 72 cases that had available clinical follow-up data formed the basis of this study.Results:The mean (range) age of the patients was 64 (48-87) years, the median (mean, range) serum prostatic specific antigen level was 7.8 (64.8, 0.3-1505) ng/mL, and 60 of the patients (83%) had abnormalities on a digital rectal examination. The mean (range) number of malignant cores was 7.7 (1-23); the mean percentage of carcinoma in each core was 69.6%, and that in the core(s) with EPE was 76.8%. The mean Gleason score in the core(s) with EPE was 8, with a mean highest Gleason score per case of 8.4. Perineural invasion was detected in 54 cases (75%). Ten of 11 patients treated surgically had EPE on the radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen; also six had positive resection margins, five showed invasion into the seminal vesicles and one had lymph node metastasis. The Gleason scores in nine of the RP specimens did not differ from the highest grade found in the associated biopsies (score 9 in three, 8 in two, 7 in four); in one case it increased (from score 6 to 8) and in one it decreased (from score 9 to 8). Patients were followed for a mean (median, range) of 2.9 (2, 0.1-9) years, with metastases identified in 29 (40%); 10 (14%) died from the disease.Conclusion:EPE on needle core biopsy of the prostate is strongly associated with extensive, high-grade prostatic adenocarcinoma, such that its usefulness as an isolated prognostic factor is relatively limited."

Sham-operated and PBOO rats were evaluated for urodynamic and erectile function at 4-8 weeks after surgery. Erectile responses to electrical field stimulation (EFS) to the major pelvic ganglion, and to erectogenic agents (1,1-diethyl-2-hydroxy-2-nitroso-hydrazine, DEA-NO, and Y-27632) were evaluated and the area under the curve (AUC, a product of the intracavernous pressure and duration) was used to denote the erectile response.Results:Experimental PBOO in rats significantly increased the mean (sem) bladder weight, to 256 (25) mg in PBOO rats vs 123 (24) mg in sham controls, and the voiding frequency to 1.01 (0.1) voids/min vs 0.72 (0.14) voids/min in sham controls (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the erectile response to EFS, with a mean AUC in sham control rats at 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 V of 2603 (372), 3200 (332) and 3357 (166), respectively, vs 2273 (183), 3794 (211) and 4177 (306) in PBOO rats (P > 0.05); or to the erectogenic agents, the AUC for DEA-NO being 9000 (975) in PBOO rats vs 13 201 (2756) in sham controls, and the AUC for Y-27 632 being 44 915 (2462) and 45 907 (7408), respectively (P > 0.05). There was greater immunoreactivity to RhoA in bladder and penile tissues of PBOO than control rats.Conclusion:PBOO does not affect erectile function in rats. Additional mechanisms or pathways might be involved in lower urinary tract symptom-related erectile dysfunction in humans."

The erectile response expressed as a ratio of intracavernosal pressure (ICP)/mean arterial pressure (MAP), evaluated after electrical stimulation of the right cavernous nerve. The isometric tension of corpus cavernosum smooth muscle (CCSM) was measured in organ-bath experiments. NOS expression was determined immunohistochemically for neuronal (n)NOS and by Western blot analysis for endothelial (e) and inducible (i) NOS protein. cGMP levels were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Results:The erectile response was diminished in the HT group. Nitrergic and endothelium-dependent relaxation was reduced, while the relaxation response to sodium nitroprusside and contractile response to phenylephrine were not altered in CCSM from L-NAME-treated rats. HT rats showed decreased expression of nNOS, whereas eNOS and iNOS protein expression was increased. Sildenafil partly restored endothelial and molecular changes in CCSM from HT rats, but did not reverse the decreased erectile response, even as cGMP levels returned to normal levels.Conclusions:Sildenafil treatment did not correct the ED in L-NAME-treated HT rats. Under sustained high blood pressure, up-regulation of PDE5 expression failed to reverse the depletion of neuronal NO and/or impaired nNOS activity. However, endothelium-dependent relaxation was restored. Drug targeting of neuronal dysfunction might delay the onset of ED in HT."

There was no significant difference in the frequency of membranous syndecan-1 expression between localized prostate cancer and benign glands (25.7% vs 24.7% of cases, respectively). However, benign glands showed significantly higher intensity staining than localized prostate cancer. We found no significant association between syndecan-1 expression and any of the following: Gleason score, pathological stage, surgical margin status and biochemical recurrence.Conclusion:The current available evidence, from the present and previous studies, show that syndecan-1 is not an independent predictor of recurrence or tumour-specific survival, diminishing its significance as a clinical marker."

Six patients (2.3%) developed local recurrence of urothelial cancer (UC) within the urethra after this treatment. The median (range) time to presentation with recurrence after RC was 2.4 (0.7-3.6) years for pT1-4 UC. Recurrences were treated with various methods, including transurethral resection, urethrectomy with conversion of neobladder to continent catheterizable diversion, and chemotherapy. At the last follow-up, four of these six patients were alive without disease, one was alive with disease, and one had died from disease.Conclusions:In our experience, local recurrences involving the urethra are infrequent. Complete surgical excision can provide a good outcome. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be considered for recurrences with adverse clinicopathological features."

These were set up for tension recording and superfused with Krebs' medium (36 degrees C). Contractions were evoked by noradrenaline or high [K(+)](o) (in the presence of the L-type Ca(2+) agonist, FPL 64176) and the effects of Ca(2+) antagonists were determined.Results:Noradrenaline (0.1-100 micromol/L) evoked rhythmic and tonic contractions of longitudinal and circular muscles, which were potently inhibited by nifedipine (<or=0.1 micromol/L). Mibefradil (1-10 micromol/L) inhibited the contractions but was comparatively more effective in longitudinal than circular muscle. Flunarizine was ineffective except against contractions to low concentrations of noradrenaline. The drugs' potencies as antagonists of L-type VOCs were determined against contractions to high K(+) (120 mmol/L in the presence of FPL 64176, 1 micromol/L). The contractions in longitudinal and circular muscle had different times to peak and decline but were inhibited comparably by nifedipine (50% inhibitory concentration, IC(50), longitudinal and circular muscle, approximately 2 nmol/L) or by mibefradil (IC(50) longitudinal muscle, 1.1 micromol/L; circular muscle, 2.4 micromol/L) and were less sensitive to flunarizine (up to 30 micromol/L).Conclusion:These results indicate that noradrenaline-induced contractions of human vas deferens depend primarily on nifedipine-sensitive L-type VOCs, as opposed to mibefradil/flunarizine-sensitive T-type VOCs. The effects of mibefradil and flunarizine, at concentrations found to be effective against noradrenaline-induced contractions, involve the blockade of L-type VOCs. The modest differential effect of mibefradil in longitudinal and circular muscle is discussed in relation to factors that modulate activation and drug-sensitivity of L-type VOCs."

Semen was first evaluated on a wet-slide preparation. Those samples with no ('azoospermia') or sporadic immotile spermatozoa could be cleared without further analysis. Samples with motile sperm were immediately labelled as potentially fertile, while those with a significant number of immotile sperm were re-analysed using a Neubauer haemocytometer. All samples with <100 000 immotile sperm/mL were cleared.Results:Of men providing semen at 3 months after vasectomy, 96% could be cleared. No sperm were seen ('azoospermia') in 51.3% of samples, and 44.7% of samples contained <100 000 immotile sperm. No paternity has been reported in the cleared group after a follow-up of at least 1 year.Conclusions:A protocol stipulating that patients can be cleared after a single semen sample containing <100 000 immotile sperm/mL at > or = 3 months after vasectomy is safe and dramatically reduces the number of men who cannot be cleared at 3 months after vasectomy."

        "Abstract": "(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is one of the major polyphenol components in green tea. It effectively induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. The anticancer effect of this reagent is appealing because it is a natural component of a popular daily beverage that has proven harmless for thousands of years, making it a good candidate chemopreventive agent. EGCG suppresses cell growth and causes cell death, but the mechanisms are not well characterized, especially in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. In the present study, using Affymetrix genechip Hu133 2.0, we analyzed the gene expression patterns of the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line Du145, treated with or without EGCG, and found 40 genes whose expression levels were altered (>twofold, either upregulated or downregulated, P < 0.01) upon treatment with EGCG. These gene products are involved in the functions of transcription, RNA processing, protein folding, phosphorylation, protein degradation, cell motility, and ion transport. Among them, inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (ID2), known as a dominant anti-retinoblastoma (Rb) helix-loop-helix protein, was found to be downregulated fourfold by EGCG treatment. Forced expression of ID2 in Du145 cells reduced apoptosis and increased cell survival in the presence of EGCG, and knockdown ID2 expression in Du145 cells using a morpholino oligonucleotide specific for ID2 mimicked the apoptosis effect generated by EGCG treatment, although it was milder. To our knowledge, this is the first report indicating that ID2 is one of the critical factors in the signaling pathway of Du145 cell death induced by EGCG."

Accumulating evidence has indicated that two common genetic variants, C677T and A1298C, are associated with cancer risk. We hypothesized that these two variants were associated with childhood ALL susceptibility and influence serum MTHFR levels. We genotyped these two polymorphisms and detected MTHFR levels in a case-control study of 361 cases and 508 controls. Compared with the 677CC and 677CC/CT genotypes, the 677TT genotype was associated with a statistically significantly decreased risk of childhood ALL (odds ratio = 0.53, 95% confidence interval = 0.32-0.88, and odds ratio = 0.55, 95% confidence interval = 0.35-0.88, respectively). In addition, a pronounced reduced risk of ALL was observed among low-risk ALL and B-phenotype ALL. Moreover, the mean serum MTHFR level was 8.01 ng/mL (+/-4.38) in cases and 9.27 ng/mL (+/-4.80) in controls (P < 0.001). MTHFR levels in subjects with 677TT genotype was significantly higher than those with 677CC genotype (P = 0.010) or 677CT genotype (P = 0.043) in controls. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that the MTHFR polymorphisms might contribute to reduced childhood ALL risk in this population."

Subgingival plaque samples from the adjacent, occluding, and contralateral natural teeth were collected prior to second-stage surgery. Samples from implant sulci were then obtained 2 weeks later. Detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed by the polymerase chain reaction.Results:The detection rates for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum in all subgingival samples from natural teeth were similar to that in the peri-implant sulci. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed an association between the detection of A. actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and F. nucleatum in the gingival crevices of adjacent teeth and that of the peri-implant sulcus, but no association for Tannerella forsythia.Conclusions:The present findings suggest that colonization by A. actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and F. nucleatum at the implant sulcus was affected by these microorganisms in the gingival crevice of adjacent teeth rather than those on occluding and contralateral teeth."

We report a direct comparison of three different blood-culture systems and four indirect tests. One hundred and fourteen episodes either with haematological disease and fever despite antibacterials, or with documented invasive candidiasis, were enrolled prospectively. Clinical, para-clinical information and surveillance cultures were obtained. Blood culture was performed using conventional blood-culture bottles, mycosis bottles, and the Isolator 10 lysis centrifugation system. Serum D-arabinitol/L-arabinitol (DA/LA) ratios were determined by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Antigen, mannan-antigen (Ag) and anti-mannan antibody (Ab) were detected by CandTec, Platelia Candida Ag ELISA and Candida AB/AC/AK kits, respectively. Episodes were classified as proven (n = 24), probable (n = 14), possible (n = 52) or unlikely (n = 24) invasive candidiasis. Candidaemia involved C. albicans (17), C. albicans + C. glabrata (3), C. tropicalis (1) and yeast (1). Mycosis bottles yielded two additional positives and the conventional blood culture yielded one positive not identified by other blood-culture methods. Considering proven and unlikely episodes, respectively, sensitivity and specificity were as follows: mannan-Ag and/or anti-mannan Ab: 83.3%, 78.3%; DA/LA ratio: 41.7%, 86.4%; and CandTec Candida Ag: 66.6%, 70.8%. Lowering the cut-off values to mannan-Ag 0.10 ng/mL and anti-mannan Ab 4 AU/mL, the values were: 100%, 73.9%. Applying the DA/LA ratio to only patients with haematological neutropenia the values were: 75%, 90.5%. Fungal blood culture allowed slightly improved detection of candidaemia. The best indirect test performance was obtained from combined mannan-Ag and anti-mannan Ab detection, especially with lower cut-offs. DA/LA ratio appears to be useful in the context of haematological neutropenia."

It is clear that C. difficile can be commonly found in food animals and food in many regions, and that strains important in human infections, such as ribotype 027/NAP1/toxinotype III and ribotype 078/toxinotype V, are often present. However, it is currently unclear whether ingestion of contaminated food can result in colonization or infection. Many questions remain unanswered regarding the role of C. difficile in community-associated diarrhoea: its source when it is a food contaminant, the infective dose, and the association between ingestion of contaminated food and disease. The significant role of this pathogen in human disease and its potential emergence as an important community-associated pathogen indicate that careful evaluation of different sources of exposure, including food, is required, but determination of the potential role of food in C. difficile infection may be difficult."

        "Abstract": "The widespread use of antimicrobial agents, in combination with insufficient infection control measures, is the main driver of the current pandemic of antimicrobial resistance in human pathogens. The use of antimicrobials in food animal production also contributes, because resistant organisms and resistance genes can spread from animals to humans by direct contact or through the food chain. An important, traditionally human, pathogen, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), is currently endemic in many hospitals around the world and has also emerged in the community. Recently, a new reservoir of MRSA has been identified in food production animals and people in contact with these animals. This involves a specific clone, multilocus sequence type 398 (ST398), which has spread extensively among animals. ST398 has also been found in up to 11.9% of retail meat samples in several surveys from different parts of the world, posing a potential threat to human health."

        "Abstract": "Listeria monocytogenes is the causative agent of human listeriosis, a potentially fatal foodborne infection. Clinical manifestations range from febrile gastroenteritis to more severe invasive forms, including sepsis, meningitis, rhombencephalitis, perinatal infections, and abortions. In recent years, an increasing rate of listeriosis has been reported in several European countries. These increases primarily reflect a higher rate of bacteraemic listeriosis in those > or =65 years of age, and are not otherwise correlated with geography, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic factors or infectious serotypes. In the late 1980s, an upsurge in listeriosis rates was due to the contamination of a small number of food products. However, a restricted range of strains was responsible for most of the additional cases at that time, and no evidence exists for such a pattern since 2001. From a clinical perspective, the importance of isolating the pathogen as a prerequisite for an accurate epidemiological investigation and ultimately stopping transmission cannot be overemphasized."

        "Abstract": "Hepatitis E, which is caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV), may now be considered a zoonosis as well as an anthroponosis. Pigs, boars and deer have been identified as reservoirs, and their flesh and entrails--as meat and offal--as vehicles of HEV transmission. Shellfish also act as vehicles. Dietary, gastronomic and culinary preferences influence how extensively HEV conveyed by these vehicles can be inactivated before their ingestion by the host. Another route of infection is paved by HEV that is enterically shed by humans and by live animals into the environment. Although anthroponotic transmission of HEV is primarily environmental, zoonotic transmission may proceed along both foodborne and environmental routes."

Unfortunately, serious complications have been identified. The aim of the present study was to analyse the complications and their treatment to see where they might be avoided and to determine best management.Method:All Units of Coloproctology belonging to the Italian Unitary Society of Coloproctology (SIUCP) were asked to return documentation of serious complications following SH and STARR.Results:Forty-six reports were received from 23 centres. Twenty-seven serious complications were reported. Twenty occurred after SH (13 PPH 03, 7 PPH 01) (Endo-surgery Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio, USA) and seven after STARR. Complications were treated by abdominal operation in nine patients [colostomy (3), ileostomy (2), Hartmann's resection (1) and anterior resection (1)].Conclusion:Stapled haemorrhoidopexy and STARR can result in serious complications requiring major surgery for their treatment."

This study investigated whether the disparity in adenoma aggressiveness reflects underlying differences in histogenesis.Method:Normal mucosal biopsies and 2-3 mm adenomas from patients with FAP were dissected into individual crypts. Crypt area, morphology, fission and mitoses were analysed for crypts from pouch, rectum and supra-anastomotic ileum. Immunohistochemistry of similar archival samples was performed for lysozyme, β-catenin and TP53 expression.Results:The morphology of normal crypts was similar at each site, although crypt area differed. The area of normal pouch crypts was intermediate between rectum and ileum. The area of adenomatous crypts of rectum and pouch was similar, but the latter had increased asymmetrical fission. Crypt mitoses were proportional to area in all tissues, but crypt fission was reduced in adenomatous crypts from the rectum compared with the pouch. Pouch adenomas retained lysozyme expression as seen in normal ileum. Nuclear β-catenin accumulation was similar, but TP53 expression was increased in rectal adenomas.Conclusion:Diminutive polyps from rectum and pouch differ in morphology and proliferation. Aggressiveness in rectal polyps is not conferred by increased crypt proliferation, fission, or activation of the Wnt signalling pathway. Increased TP53 expression suggests other molecular mechanisms may be responsible. While crypt mitoses are proportional to crypt area, the threshold for fission may be site specific, indicating that tissue origin may influence histogenesis and thus malignant potential."

The literature contains two reports of SILS right hemicolectomy, and we report our experience of this technique.Method:Seven consecutive, unselected patients underwent SILS retrocaecal appendicectomy, right hemicolectomy, extended right hemicolectomy, colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis, proctocolectomy, anterior resection and restorative proctocolectomy/ileoanal pouch using a single Triport (Olympus Keymed, Southend, UK), conventional instrumentation and nerve block analgesia. Three had undergone previous surgery, two had cancer and two were immunosuppressed.Results:Umbilical, right- and left-iliac fossa SILS was feasible using conventional instruments. Operative time ranged between 23 and 195 min (median 48 min). Four patients tolerated normal diet within 6 h (12-16 h for the remainder). Only one patient required postoperative enteral morphine (10 mg × 4). Discharge occurred between 8 and 90 h (median 16 h) of surgery. A secondary haemorrhage from the ileorectal anastomosis was managed conservatively.Conclusion:SILS colorectal resection is feasible and safe when performed by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon and theatre team. It may have advantages over conventional laparoscopic surgery in terms of reduced pain, lower cost, faster recovery and cosmesis."

However, among patients with Crohn's disease (CD), RPC is generally not recommended, as outcome and long-term function may be poor. Our purpose was to compare matched cohorts of CD and CUC patients to determine whether there are differences in outcome or function.Method:We queried our prospectively maintained database of patients who underwent RPC from 1991 to 2008. We identified patients who underwent RPC for CD and compared them with a matched cohort of patients who underwent RPC for CUC.Results:We identified 13 patients with CD (seven women, median age 34 years) and 39 patients with CUC (21 women, median age 35 years). The patients were well matched for gender, clinical and demographic variables. Seven patients (54%) with CD had proctitis, but none had perianal or ileal disease. There were four (30.8%) postoperative complications and no anastomotic leaks. The CD group experienced significantly fewer median daily bowel movements (P = 0.02), incontinence for liquids (P < 0.01) and pouchitis (P < 0.01). With a median follow up of 44 months, pouch excision rate was significantly higher in the Crohn's group (2 vs 0%, P < 0.01).Conclusion:In patients with CD, RPC may result in fewer daily bowel movements, less liquid incontinence and a lower incidence of pouchitis compared with CUC patients who undergo RPC. However, risk of pouch loss is higher in patients with CD. Therefore, in properly selected patients with CD, RPC provides an acceptable long-term functional outcome."

The HRQOL score was compared with 4152 individuals from the general Norwegian population using the SF-36 questionnaire, and function was evaluated using the Wexner Continence Grading Scale.Results:One hundred and ten (71%) patients answered the questionnaires, 60 (55%) of whom were men. All except five patients had ulcerative colitis. Median (range) age at interview was 47 (19-66) years, and time after surgery was 12 (2-22) years. The IPAA patients scored slightly, but significantly, lower in four of six SF-36 health domains than the control subjects, adjusted for age and gender. Multiple regression analysis showed frequency of nocturnal defaecation, faecal incontinence and urgency to be independent negative prognostic factors of quality of life. Frequency of defaecation was a median of 7 (3-12) bowel movements during the day and 2 (0-6) at night. The majority had some degree of faecal incontinence, median (range) Wexner score of 8 (0-17), and 40% reported urgency of defaecation necessitating alterations in lifestyle.Conclusion:Patients with IPAA reported slightly lower HRQOL rates than the general population and had an inferior functional outcome."

All patients were female, with a mean age of 54 years (range 41-72 years). The mean distance of the tumour from the anal verge was 6 cm (range 4-10 cm). Seven patients were treated with curative intent (two postoperative, three preoperative, two chemoradiotherapy alone). Clinical stages for the curative group were T1N0M0 (1), T3N0M0 (3), T3N1M0 (1) and T4N0M0 (2). Chemoradiotherapy consisted of pelvic radiation 45-54 Gy in 1.8 Gy/fraction and concurrent 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C. The mean follow-up duration for the curative group was 39 months (range 15-120 months).Results:All seven patients treated with curative intent achieved local control. A complete pathological response was seen in all patients after preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Two patients did not have surgery and remained free of disease. One patient with gross residual disease after surgery achieved local control. 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity was detected in all patients who had FDG-PET scans. Both primary and metastatic tumours demonstrated FDG-avidity.Conclusion:Primary squamous-cell carcinoma of the rectum appears to be very sensitive to chemoradiotherapy. The high complete response rate suggests that chemoradiotherapy alone with salvage surgery for local failure should be further explored. FDG-PET scan may have a role to play in the management of this disease."

The completeness of resection of the mesorectum has been proposed as an indicator of the 'quality' of the resection. We determined the prognostic value of macroscopic evaluation of rectal cancer resection specimens and the circumferential resection margin (CRM) after curative surgery.Method:From 1999 to 2006, the macroscopic quality of the mesorectum and the CRM were prospectively assessed in 127 patients who underwent rectal cancer resection with curative intent (R0+R1). Chemoradiotherapy was administered for 61 tumours staged as locally advanced tumours (T3, T4 and N+). Univariate analysis of time to local recurrence and cancer-free survival were tested (Kaplan-Meier) and multivariate analysis calculated with a Cox regression model.Results:The mesorectum was incomplete in 34 (26.8%) patients. At a median follow up of 34 months (range, 9-96 months), in the group with an adequate mesorectal excision, the cumulative risk of local recurrence at 5 years was 10%. This was 25% if the mesorectum was incomplete (P < 0.01). Five-year cancer-free survival was 65% if the mesorectal excision was adequate and 47% if it was not (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis identified T status, the CRM and the mesorectal score as independent factors for local recurrence, and T and N status and the mesorectal score as independent factors for disease-free survival.Conclusion:The outcome of surgical treatment of rectal cancer is related to the completeness of mesorectal excision. It is a more discriminative prognostic factor than the classic tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) system."

A logistic regression model was used to determine factors which influenced the therapeutic approach and outcome.Results:The overall anastomotic leakage rate was 3.5%. All patients were re-operated. The anastomosis was resected without restoration of continuity in 31 but preserved in 36 patients. An ileostomy was constructed in 27 of 36 patients with anastomotic leakage after repair or revision of the anastomosis, the remaining nine cases were treated without ileostomy. Five of these latter nine vs three of the 27 patients with ileostomy experienced re-leakage (P = 0.05). The overall mortality was 25%. The Mannheim Peritonitis Index was 17.44 for survivors vs 25.64 for nonsurvivors (P < 0.001). Restoration of intestinal continuity was performed in 95% of the patients with ileostomy and in 88% after Hartmann's procedure. Multivariate analysis identified multi organ failure as the only factor predictive of a fatal outcome (P < 0.001). An ASA-score of more than 2 (P = 0.02) and peritonitis (P = 0.002) were reasons for not preserving the anastomosis.Conclusion:Repair or redo of the anastomosis without a protective ileostomy frequently results in failure of the procedure. After Hartmann's operation or split stoma creation a majority of patients undergo restoration of intestinal continuity."

Between June 1995 and August 2009, a total of 35 patients with achalasia underwent an LHD. The symptom scores were calculated by combining the frequency and the severity. Pre- and postoperative evaluations included symptom score, radiology, manometry, and 24-hour pH manometry. Median total symptom score was significantly lower than the preoperative score (19 vs 4, P < 0.001) at a median follow-up of 94 months. Among the 35 patients, 18 (51%) had chest pain. The frequency of chest pain was similar for the pre- and postoperative scores, but the severity tended to be less. Median esophageal diameter (5.4 cm vs 3.5 cm, P < 0.001) and lower esophageal sphincter pressure (41 mmHg vs 8.9 mmHg, P < 0.001) were significantly reduced after surgery. Median age, duration of symptoms, esophageal diameter, and lower esophageal sphincter pressure were similar between patients with and without chest pain prior to surgery. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of amplitude, duration, and frequency of contractions from the findings of postoperative 24-hour esophageal manometry. Chest pain resolved in three patients (17%) and improved in seven patients (39%) after surgery. LHD can durably relieve achalasic symptoms of both dysphagia and regurgitation, and it can be considered the surgical procedure of choice. However, achalasic chest pain does not always seem to be related with patient characteristics and manometric findings."

Our objective in this study was to investigate functional changes of the esophagus after Heller myotomy and evaluate their influence on postoperative gastroesophageal reflux and esophageal morphologic changes. Between 1980 and 2003, 216 patients with achalasia underwent Heller myotomy, associated with anterior partial fundoplication (Dor fundoplication). Preoperative and long-term outcome data were collected from these patients at our hospital. The objective was to analyze esophageal functional results after Heller myotomy in the long term. Results were classified as excellent, good, fair, or poor, according to Vantrappen and Hellemans' modified classification. One-year, 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 20-year postoperative follow-up information was available in 100% of all patients, 91.7%, 85.1%, 60%, 52.6%, and 45.9%, respectively. There were no perioperative deaths. One year after the surgery, all patients had a significant reduction in symptoms of dysphagia and regurgitation. Five years, 10 years, 15 years, and 20 years after surgery, there were 77.2% of patients (142 in 184), 68.1%, 57.1%, and 54.5%, respectively, who were satisfied (excellent to good) with surgery. No esophageal peristalsis was demonstrated in patients during follow-up. Contractile waves in the body of the esophagus were simultaneous. The difference in the distal esophageal amplitude, the LES relaxation rate, and LES pressures in the anterior wall and/ or two sides was significant (P < 0.05) when compared before and after operation. However, there was no significant difference in the LES length and LES pressure in the posterior side. The change of direction of the LES pressure and the relaxation of LES correlate with long-term outcomes. Postoperative gastroesophageal reflux rates, including nocturnal reflux, increased with time. The percentage of patients whose esophageal diameter became normal or remained mildly increased with time in the first 10 years after surgery changed significantly. Myotomy is an effective way to palliate symptoms in patients with achalasia. Adequate myotomy can lead to reduction of LES pressure in two or three directions, which may facilitate esophageal emptying by gravity. Surgical intervention does not lead to the return of esophageal peristalsis. Functional damage of LES in patients with achalasia is irreversible."

To date, several studies have been performed investigating genetic, immune, and infectious disease mechanisms; however, none of these have been conclusive. Further research into this topic is warranted given the severity of the disease, and it may be possible that all of these mechanisms are involved in the pathophysiology of the disease."

        "Abstract": "It has been reported that an increased population of regulatory T cells (T-regs) is one of the reasons for impaired anti-tumor immunity. We investigated the frequency of Foxp3(+) T-regs in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Furthermore, in order to elucidate the mechanisms behind T-regs accumulation within tumors, we evaluated the relationship between CCL17 or CCL22 expression and the frequency of Foxp3(+) T-regs. CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T-regs as a percentage of CD4(+) cells were counted by flow cytometry. The frequency of CCL17(+) or CCL22(+) cells among CD14(+) cells in tumors was also evaluated by flow cytometry. Moreover, an in vitro migration assay using T-regs derived from ESCC was performed in the presence of CCL17 or CCL22. The frequency of Foxp3(+) T-regs in TILs was significantly higher than that in the normal esophageal mucosa (24.6 +/- 10.0 vs 7.1 +/- 5.9%, P < 0.01). The frequency of Foxp3(+) T-regs in PBLs of ESCC patients was significantly higher than that in normal healthy donors (7.0 +/- 4.2 vs 2.5 +/- 1.0%, P < 0.01). Furthermore, the frequency of CCL17(+) or CCL22(+) cells among CD14(+) cells within tumors was significantly higher than that of normal esophageal mucosa, and there was a significant correlation between the frequency of CCL17(+) or CCL22(+) cells and Foxp3(+) T-regs in TILs. In addition, the in vitro migration assay indicated that T-regs were significantly induced to migrate by CCL17 or CCL22. In conclusion, CCL17 and CCL22 within the tumor are related to the increased population of Foxp3(+) T-regs in ESCC."

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and pH-metric effect of treatment with pantoprazole 80 mg for 8 weeks in patients with ear, nose, and throat (ENT) manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease associated with pathological proximal acid exposure. We conducted a prospective open study. Patients included had to have chronic pharyngitis or laryngitis, and a pathological gastroesophagopharyngeal reflux. All patients received treatment with pantoprazole 80 mg daily for 8 weeks. One week after the end treatment, patients had a second ENT examination and a 24-hour pH monitoring using dual-channel probe. We included 33 patients (11 men, 22 women). A pathological distal acid reflux was found in 30 patients (91%). After treatment, the improvement of ENT symptoms was found in 51.5% of patients. Normalization of 24-hour proximal esophageal pH monitoring was observed in 22 patients (66%). After treatment, the overall distal acid exposure, the number of distal reflux events, and the number of reflux during more than 5 minutes were significantly decreased (respectively: 19.4% vs 7.2% [P < 0.0001], 62.7 vs 28.4 [P < 0.0001], and 10.4 vs 3.9 [P < 0.0001] ). Similarly, in proximal level, the same parameters were significantly decreased after treatment (respectively: 6.8% vs 1.6% [P < 0.0001], 32.6 vs 8.1 [P < 0.0001], and 3.4 vs 0.6 [P= 0.005] ). Treatment with pantoprazole reduced the frequency and severity of gastroesophagopharyngeal acid reflux in patients with chronic pharyngitis and laryngitis."

        "Abstract": "One of the most important elements behind the success of Community-based Therapeutic Care (CTC) programmes for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition has been their ability to achieve high levels of coverage. In CTC, coverage is measured using the Centric System Area Sampling (CSAS) method, which provides accurate and reliable estimates of programme coverage as well as information on the primary reasons for non-attendance. Another important feature of CTC programmes is their use of socio-cultural assessments to determine potential barriers to access and to develop context-specific responses. By analysing data on non-attendance provided by CSAS surveys, in conjunction with data from socio-cultural assessments, it is possible to identify common factors responsible for failures in programme coverage. This paper focuses on an analysis of data from 12 CTC programmes across five African countries. It pinpoints three common factors (distance to sites, community awareness of the programme, and the way in which rejections are handled at the sites) that, together, account for approximately 75 per cent of non-attendance."

Analysis of them illustrates that they increase difficulties for local development-frequently affecting the livelihoods of poor people and perpetuating their level of poverty and human insecurity-and entail challenges for a country's development. In contrast to extreme events, small disasters are often invisible at the national level and their effects are not considered as relevant from a macroeconomic standpoint. Nevertheless, their accumulated impact causes economic, environmental and social problems. This paper presents the results of an evaluation of the DesInventar database, developed in 1994 by the Network for Social Studies in Disaster Prevention in Latin America. In addition, it proposes a new version of the Local Disaster Index developed in 2005 within the framework of the Disaster Risk and Management Indicators Program for the Americas, with the support of the Inter-American Development Bank."

Failure to implement rapidly a communication response system may result in the public overwhelming hospitals. This paper shares Israel's experience in developing and maintaining a national system for supplying information on the location and identification of casualties. ADAM interfaces online with hospitals' patient registration systems, and allows for immediate electronic transfer of designated data. The system permits information centres to access information on which hospital has admitted identified and unidentified casualties. The latter are photographed at the entrance to the hospital and the picture is stored in ADAM. The system enables hospitals and municipalities to ensure immediate availability and accessibility of information and thus (in our belief) mitigate the concerns of family and friends. Use of such an interface system is recommended as an integral element of emergency preparedness."

A high level of seismic hazard in some of these places, coupled with a relatively high degree of vulnerability within the built environment, can result in dire human and economic consequences. This paper contains examples of such potentially disruptive factors in relation to Tehran, Iran. It presents preliminary seismic loss estimates for residential buildings in a pilot area of northern Tehran. The paper briefly investigates the effectiveness of risk management measures and loss compensation mechanisms before assessing the feasibility of an insurance-based risk transfer instrument for managing potential seismic losses among residential buildings in Tehran. It goes on to suggest how probabilistic catastrophe loss modelling can help local insurers to manage their portfolios and facilitate risk sharing among insurance companies and households. Finally, the paper addresses the question of how catastrophe loss modelling can help to strengthen the penetration of property insurance in developing countries."

Nevertheless, most resources are allocated after an event in geographical areas that are vulnerable to natural disasters. This paper analyses the cost-effectiveness of ex-ante adaptation measures in the wake of earthquakes and provides an assessment of the future role of private and public agencies in disaster risk management. The study uses a simulation model approach to evaluate consumption losses after earthquakes under different scenarios of intervention. Particular attention is given to the role of activity diversification measures in enhancing disaster preparedness and the contributions of (targeted) microcredit and education programmes for reconstruction following a disaster. Whereas the former measures are far more cost-effective, missing markets and perverse incentives tend to make ex-post measures a preferred option, thus occasioning underinvestment in ex-ante adaptation initiatives."

        "Abstract": "Early pregnancy bleeding is a common presentation in the emergency setting. Traditionally, its assessment relied on clinical findings, including pelvic examination. However in recent years, ultrasonography and quantitative beta human chorionic gonadotropin assays have gained prominence and are now first-line in diagnosing early pregnancy bleeding. Accordingly, the role of pelvic examination in the acute setting has been increasingly questioned. This article reviews the evidence for the role of pelvic examination in the assessment of early pregnancy bleeding in the ED. A Medline search was conducted and 43 articles were included in this review. Applicable research is largely observational and of a low level of evidence. However, available data indicate that the role of pelvic examination in the assessment of early pregnancy bleeding is limited, providing that there is prompt access to transvaginal ultrasound examination. Pelvic examination does not provide further diagnostic information over ultrasonography used in conjunction with beta human chorionic gonadotropin assays. The routine use of pelvic examination is not supported by the literature. However, when ultrasonography and beta human chorionic gonadotropin testing are unavailable or the results inconclusive, pelvic examination should be considered. Assessment in these instances must focus on identifying possible life-threatening conditions, such as ectopic pregnancy, as well as determining the safety of discharge pending definitive assessment. Speculum examination is indicated in those presenting with severe bleeding or hypotension as removal of obstructing endocervical products can be a crucial resuscitative measure."

Anecdotally, blowing into a 10 mL syringe to move the plunger is one method of pressure generation; however, to date its effectiveness has not been tested. The objective of the present study was to assess if blowing into a syringe sufficient to move the plunger could produce the required 40 mmHg of pressure.Methods:A two-part experimental study tested the pressure required to move the plunger, and sustain that movement for 15 s, in a Terumo syringe. Part one tested a range of syringe sizes. Part two, a repeated measures study, tested the syringe to ascertain if a pressure reduction occurred after repeated use. A sphygmomanometer was attached to the syringe via a 10 cm length of tubing with another length of tubing attached to the sphygmomanometer enabling an investigator to blow into the syringe.Results:In part one, the 10 mL syringe was the only size noted to provide the required 40 mmHg pressure to move the plunger. In part two, the mean for each of the three tests per syringe varied between 37.0 mmHg (95% CI 34.2-39.8) and 40.2 mmHg (95% CI 37.5-43.0). There was no statistically significant fall noted over three uses of the same syringe.Conclusion:The present study has demonstrated that blowing into a 10 mL Terumo syringe, to move the plunger, generated 40 mmHg intrathoracic pressure, thereby meeting the recommended intrathoracic pressure for optimum VM performance."

Main outcome was the proportion of adverse coronary events (defined a priori) within 30 days.Results:Of 2627 patients, 1819 (69%) were discharged without a diagnosis of coronary syndrome and 808 (31%) were admitted for further investigation and treatment. Of these, 385 (14.7%) were given a final diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. On 30 day follow up, 18 of the discharged patients were diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (0.7%; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.4-1.1%), 10 with unstable angina (0.4%; 95% CI 0.2-0.7%) and 8 with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (0.3%; 95% CI 0.2-0.6%). There were no cases of ST elevation infarction or death. The sensitivity for diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes was 95.5% (95% CI 92.9-97.3%). Average length of stay was 7 h for discharged patients. Forty-six per cent of patients with diabetes and 47% with a past history of coronary disease were discharged. Subsequent outpatient stress testing was performed in 13.6%.Conclusions:In a large Australian ED, less than 1% of patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of coronary syndrome were discharged and subsequently had a 30 day adverse event. Reducing this proportion by admitting patients with traditional risk factors would markedly increase hospital workload. Opportunities exist to improve both the safety and efficiency of chest pain assessment in the ED."

Patient data relating to ED attendance, troponins, hospitalization and death were linked using probabilistic data linkage. Troponin results were dichotomized (normal/abnormal) according to hospitals' cut-offs across various time periods. Presentations undergoing ED troponin testing, provided that it was not within 28 days of a previous discharge involving ED troponin testing, met study inclusion criteria. Logistical regression analyses quantified risk of subsequent hospitalization and death.Results:A total of 119 646 troponin tests were performed during 83 635 ED presentations involving 54 214 patients. For the 73 965 ED presentations meeting the study criteria, 6779 (9.2%) recorded an abnormal peak troponin level and 168 (2.5%) of these presentations were discharged directly from ED. After adjusting for covariates, those discharged directly from ED with abnormal troponin results were significantly more likely to die within 2 days (OR 60.4, 95% CI 31.9-114.2), 7 days (OR 31.2, 95% CI 17.9-54.3) and 28 days (OR 19.4, 95% CI 12.5-30.1) of discharge, compared with those with normal troponin results. Adjusted odds of subsequent hospital admission within 28 days following discharge from ED were 3.3 (95% CI 2.4-4.5) times greater for presentations with abnormal versus normal troponin results.Conclusion:An abnormal ED troponin result appears to be associated with increased risk of subsequent hospitalization and death within 28 days of discharge."

Presentations to the ED the day before rose 15% (P < 0.0001, paired t-test) in 4 years, and nationally access block patients in the ED rose an average of 27%, and patients waiting to be seen by a doctor 31%. There were differences between states, with hospitals in New South Wales reporting a significant reduction in access block patients (-51%, P= 0.0002), but all other states a significant increase (+45%, P= 0.001). There were differences by role delineation, with non-paediatric major referral hospitals experiencing the greatest access block, but smaller hospitals experiencing the greatest increase in patients waiting.Conclusions:Around one-third of all patients receiving care in these ED surveys were experiencing access block. There is evidence that flow through New South Wales ED has improved. The data suggest that most hospitals have passed the point of efficiency."

        "Abstract": "Anecdotally critical incident debriefing (CID) is an important topic for staff in paediatric ED. The present study aimed to determine current baseline CID practices and perceived needs of ED staff. A questionnaire regarding CID practice was circulated to all 13 Paediatric Research in Emergency Departments International Collaborative (PREDICT) sites in Australia and New Zealand (including all tertiary paediatric ED), and completed by 1 senior doctor and 1 senior nurse. All PREDICT sites participated (13 nurses, 13 doctors). Seventy per cent did not currently have a hospital protocol on debriefing and 90% did not have ED-specific guidelines. The most commonly debriefed topics were death of a patient, multi-trauma and sudden infant death syndrome, also ranked highest in importance for debriefing. The median reported debriefs per department were 4 per year (range 0-12), all conducted within a week of the CI with half within 24 h. ED workers most likely to be invited to the CID session were doctors, nurses and social workers (96%). Debriefing was mostly conducted internally (62%) and most likely facilitated by a doctor (81%) or nurse (54%). Debriefing addressed both clinical and emotional issues (89%) within the same session (69%). Debriefing was rated as very important, median of 8/10 by doctors and 10/10 by nurses. Almost 90% of those surveyed indicated that they would like a CID programme and guidelines for their department. Debriefing is perceived as important by senior ED clinicians, yet few ED have formalized guidelines or programmes. Best-practice guidelines should be developed."

        "Abstract": "Paediatric limb fracture is a common injury that presents frequently to the ED. The primary objective of the present study was to determine whether ibuprofen provides better analgesia than paracetamol for paediatric patients discharged with acute limb fractures. A prospective, randomized controlled study was conducted in a children's ED. Children aged 5-14 years with an acute limb fracture were randomized to be prescribed paracetamol 15 mg/kg/dose every 4 h or ibuprofen 10 mg/kg/dose every 8 h. Objective (child-reported) pain scores using the 'Faces' pain scale were measured over a 48 h period. Child-reported pain did not differ significantly between the paracetamol and ibuprofen groups (mean pain score paracetamol 2.8 [95% CI 2.4-3.4] vs 2.7 [95% CI 2.1-3.3], P = 0.73). Parent-reported sleep quality did not differ between the two groups (P = 0.78). Child-reported pain score decreased over the 48 h of measurement (P < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in side-effects detected between the two groups. The present study shows that in the outpatient paediatric population, ibuprofen does not provide better analgesia than paracetamol. Pain from an acute fracture can be managed by regular simple oral analgesia and immobilization."

        "Abstract": "A recent measles case in a paediatric hospital ED resulted in 111 individuals (patients, family members and health-care workers) potentially being exposed to measles. This report documents the efforts taken to contact trace and provide best practice care for all those exposed to the index case. It also provides a snapshot of community prevalence information on immunity to measles. One hundred per cent of contacted children (n = 24) eligible for vaccination were immunized, whereas 96% of adults surveyed or tested (n = 44) had assumed or proven immunity. However, six infants aged between 6 and 9 months were exposed and might have been a sufficiently large reservoir to facilitate the ongoing spread of measles in the community, if contact tracing and preventative measures had not occurred. This scenario also highlights the need to consider measles in the ED, particularly among travellers, with urgent isolation of suspected cases in the ED according to guidelines discussed."

        "Abstract": "The objective of the present study was to determine emergency physicians' training, experience and perceptions as expert witnesses. Emergency physicians of an adult tertiary referral and teaching hospital participated in a pilot survey regarding their experiences in report writing and in court as expert witnesses. The 28-item survey also examined the amount of formalized forensic medical teaching that emergency physicians had received during their training. Of the participants, 41% (95% CI 21.6-64.1; 7/17) had never received any undergraduate or postgraduate training in forensic medicine, 11/17 (65%, 95% CI 41.2-82.8) had provided a written expert opinion for court, and 12/17 (71%, 95% CI 46.6-87.0) had attended court as an expert witness. All participants considered themselves 'skilled in attending an emergency resuscitation', whereas 3/13 (23%, 95% CI 7.5-50.9) considered themselves 'skilled in attending a courtroom trial'. Nearly 90% (95% CI 64.7-98.0; 15/17) thought that medical evidence training should be a requirement of emergency speciality training. The most commonly preferred forms of medical evidence training were mock court sessions (76%, 95% CI 52.2-91.0; 13/17) and forensic workshops (76%, 95% CI 52.2-91.0; 13/17). From 10 non-technical skills required of an EP, 'appearing in court as an expert witness' was perceived to be the second most difficult skill by most respondents. Emergency physicians in this pilot study have limited training for the role of expert witness and see it as one of the most difficult non-technical skills they have to perform. Further research is required regarding the current and future scope of forensic training."

In contrast, ordinary witnesses can only give evidence regarding facts that they have observed. Emergency medicine is one of a few speciality areas of medicine more likely to be involved in legal proceedings. Preparing the emergency physician to be an expert witness is an invaluable part of their training. Education in this area should concentrate on the purpose of the evidence, the legal framework in which it is delivered and the specific skill requirements of medical expert witnesses."

The aim of the present paper is to describe the evolution of the Queensland Emergency Medical System (QEMS) and to recommend a strategic national approach to EMS development.Methods:Following the formation of the Queensland Ambulance Service in 1991, a state EMS committee was formed. This committee led the development and approval of the cross portfolio QEMS policy framework that has resulted in dynamic policy development, system monitoring and evaluation. This framework is led by the Queensland Emergency Medical Services Advisory Committee.Results:There has been considerable progress in the development of all aspects of the EMS in Queensland. These developments have derived from the improved coordination and leadership that QEMS provides and has resulted in widespread satisfaction by both patients and stakeholders.Conclusions:The strategic approach outlined in the present paper offers a model for EMS arrangements throughout Australia. We propose that the Council of Australian Governments should require each state and Territory to maintain an EMS committee. These state EMS committees should have a broad portfolio of responsibilities. They should provide leadership and direction to the development of the EMS and ensure coordination and quality of outcomes. A national EMS committee with broad representation and broad scope should be established to coordinate the national development of Australia's EMS."

We present the case of a 75-year-old lady, who following a fall in her own home, sustained a dislocation of her right shoulder joint complicated by avulsion of a branch of her axillary artery. We describe the successful endovascular management of the injury using a self-expanding stent and propose this as the preferred surgical option where the artery is not completely transected."

While a complete remission was reached and maintained in BM, extramedullary plasmacytomas were refractory to every line of treatment. Genetic analysis identified the presence of t(4;14) and RB deletion in myeloma cells of both origins. However, a P53 deletion was only detected in plasma cells from extramedullary plasmacytomas. This finding suggests that P53 deletion has a role in the lack of treatment response of extramedullary plasmacytomas."

We report four families, each with a novel mutation: two missense mutations, in exons 31 and 32, and two out of frame deletions in exon 40. They were associated with no bleeding diathesis, normal, or only slightly reduced platelet count and no extra-hematological manifestations, confirming that alterations of the tail domain cause a mild form of MYH9-RD with no clinically relevant defects."

        "Abstract": "Traditionally, patients with acute leukaemia are admitted to hospital during chemotherapy-induced pancytopenia, although a few recent reports have reported the feasibility and safety of outpatient treatment. We have developed an outpatient treatment programme for patients with acute leukaemia incorporating comprehensive patient education for self-care management at home during pancytopenia and involvement of patients in care of their tunnelled central venous catheter (CVC). During neutropenia, patients are treated with prophylactic ciprofloxacine, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and fluconazole. Herein, we report the results of outpatient treatment of 60 patients with acute leukaemia (54 with acute myeloid leukaemia) followed prospectively in the period from March 2004 to 2007. After induction chemotherapy, outpatient treatment was possible after 48 of 73 induction courses, with no readmission in 19 of these (40%). A total of 129 consolidation courses were administered with outpatient treatment following 116 of these, with no readmission in 69 (59%). The median number of days spent at home with neutrophils below 0.5 x 10(9)/L was 8 d per course following induction and 12 d following consolidation chemotherapy. The predominant cause of readmission was neutropenic fever, in most instances of unknown origin. Coagulase-negative staphylococci and Enterococcus faecium were the most frequently identified bacteria in blood cultures, whereas only four positive blood cultures with multiresistant Escherichia coli were identified in the entire patient cohort, the latter exclusively observed in patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis. The majority of the patients were able to take care of their CVC including change in dressing and heparin flushing. There were 12 CVC-related infections. There were no treatment-related deaths. We conclude that outpatient treatment of patients with acute leukaemia is feasible and safe."

Our aim was to investigate the GH-IGF axis in patients with ALS and evaluate correlations between this endocrine system and clinical features.Methods:Serum levels of GH, IGF-I, IGF-II, insulin, IGF-binding protein 1 (IGF-BP1), and IGF-binding protein 3 (IGF-BP3) were measured in 25 patients with ALS and 25 age-, gender-, and BMI-matched healthy controls. A GHRH plus arginine test was performed in patients and controls. Clinical status of patients was evaluated with the ALS Functional Rating Scale - Revised (ALSFRS-R) and upper motor neuron (UMN) score.Results:GHRH plus arginine test showed GH deficiency (GHD) in 13 (52%) patients with ALS; severe GHD was found in 6 (24%) and partial GHD in 7 (28%) patients. IGF-I levels were significantly higher in patients with ALS than in healthy controls (182.9 +/- 90.8 vs. 139.4 +/- 58.1 ng/ml; P = 0.015). IGF-I levels were higher in patients with ALS with UMN score >10 than those with UMN score <10 (217.8 +/- 100.8 vs. 155.5 +/- 74.6 ng/ml, P = 0.05). IGF-II levels were significantly lower in patients with ALS than in healthy controls (720.9 +/- 215 vs. 1001.9 +/- 475.4 ng/ml; P = 0.03).Conclusions:The results demonstrate an impairment of the GH-IGFs system in ALS. The degenerative process in ALS might lead to a compensatory increase in IGF-I in an attempt to provide additional support to motor neurons or degenerating muscle fibers. The decrease in IGF-II levels may also be of pathological significance."

        "Abstract": "Background and purpose:Based upon large and carefully performed studies Xeomin was first registered in 2005. However, its real potential can only be assessed, when it is used outside of study design restrictions, in an independent setting, in off-label indications and during continued use.Methods and results:Two hundred and sixty-three patients (91 with dystonia, 84 with spasticity, 17 with hemifacial spasm and re-innervation synkinesias, 64 with hyperhidrosis, 7 with hypersalivation), who were previously treated with Botox for at least 1 year under stable conditions, were converted in a blinded fashion to Xeomin using a 1:1 conversion ratio and identical treatment parameters. Therapeutic outcome and adverse effects were monitored by neurological examination and structuralised interviews. In 223 patients (all except those with axillary hyperhidrosis) Xeomin was used continuously throughout a 3 year period. Altogether 1050 injection series were performed. Patients with dystonia received 261.5 +/- 141.0 MU Botox/Xeomin, patients with spasticity 450.5 +/- 177.1 MU, patients with hemifacial spasm and reinnervation synkinesias 44.7 +/- 19.5 MU and patients with hyperhidrosis 286.9 +/- 141.6 MU. The maximum botulinum toxin dose applied was 840 MU. There were no subjective or objective differences between Botox and Xeomin treatments with respect to onset latency, maximum and duration of their therapeutic effects and their adverse effect profiles. Long-term use did not reveal additional safety relevant aspects. None of the patients lost therapeutic efficacy during the observation period.Conclusions:Xeomin can be used safely in doses of up to 840 MU. Even when applied in high doses it did not produce secondary therapy failure. There were no diffusion differences between Botox and Xeomin. Using a conversion ratio of 1:1 Xeomin and Botox can easily be exchanged in a continued treatment."

The BoNT/A in Botox and Dysport is part of a high-molecular-weight complex that contains hemagglutinins and other non-toxic proteins, whilst Xeomin is a highly purified BoNT/A free of such complexing proteins. In the largest controlled study of BoNT/A published to date (Neurology 2005; 64: 1949), it was demonstrated that Xeomin is non-inferior to Botox and has 1:1 efficacy in the treatment of cervical dystonia. A possible limitation of continued BoNT/A treatment is antibody development. Based on its physiochemical properties and toxicological evidence, Xeomin is expected to have a reduced incidence of non-responders after long-term treatment compared with other marketed BoNT/A products.Methods and results:In our ongoing open-label study, 100 patients suffering from cervical dystonia are continuously treated with Xeomin; 50 patients were treated de novo, the remaining patients had been previously treated with Botox, Dysport or NeuroBloc/Myobloc. All patients showed negative results in antibody testing at the beginning of Xeomin treatment. During continuous treatment with Xeomin up to 2 years, patients continued to respond well to Xeomin treatment.Conclusion:The treatment was well tolerated and no patient has developed neutralizing antibodies as measured using the sensitive mouse hemidiaphragma assay within these first 2 years."

        "Abstract": "Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT/A) is a well-established treatment for conditions characterized by muscle and autonomic nerve terminal overactivity, such as cervical dystonia and blepharospasm, and hyperhidrosis, respectively. BoNT/A is not digested in the gastrointestinal tract as it forms a complex with several proteins that protect and stabilize the neurotoxin. However, the pure neurotoxin is solely responsible for the therapeutic effect, and the complexing proteins have been shown to exhibit immunostimulating activity. The complexing proteins are not required for the stabilization of the neurotoxin in a formulation; the complexing proteins immediately dissociate from the neurotoxin at a physiologic pH, so they do not influence the spread of the neurotoxin. Xeomin is the only botulinum toxin that is free from complexing proteins and is stable at room temperature for a period of 4 years. When injected directly into muscles, Xeomin inhibits local neuromuscular cholinergic transmission, causing focal weakness. It binds to motor nerve terminal pre-synaptic receptors, is internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis and then selectively cleaves a protein called SNAP-25. This is one of several so-called 'SNARE' proteins involved in exocytosis. Cleavage of SNAP-25 inhibits the secretion of acetylcholine causing the paralysis of the muscle. The clinical effects begin 24-72 h after injection, peak at approximately 4-6 weeks and are sustained for several months."

        "Abstract": "Background and purpose:Blepharospasm is classified as a focal dystonia, and botulinum toxin type A (BoNT/A) has been shown to be a highly effective and well-tolerated symptomatic treatment. Xeomin, the latest addition to BoNT/A preparations, is a purified, freeze-dried BoNT/A that is free from complexing proteins.Methods and results:In a double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre study, 300 patients with blepharospasm received either Xeomin or Botox 15-80 U (J Neural Transm 2006; 113: 303). Both treatments produced statistically significant improvements from baseline in the Jankovic Rating Scale at week 3 (primary efficacy variable; Xeomin: -2.90; Botox: -2.67; P < 0.0001 from baseline for both), with the difference between treatments (-0.23) indicating that Xeomin was clinically non-inferior to Botox. No significant differences were found between Xeomin and Botox for all secondary variables. There were no clinically relevant differences between Xeomin and Botox in safety parameters, with 40 of 148 patients (27.0%) treated with Xeomin reporting adverse events versus 45 of 155 patients (29.0%) treated with Botox. The most common adverse event was ptosis (6.1% Xeomin and 4.5% Botox).Conclusion:Clinical evidence to date suggests that Xeomin is an effective treatment for blepharospasm that does not differ from Botox in terms of its potency, duration of effect or adverse reaction profile."

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot showed that lipopolysaccharides from all strains studied are serologically identical to each other but distinct from Proteus lipopolysaccharides studied earlier and, hence, these strains could not be classified in any of the currently existing 77 Proteus O-serogroups. Accordingly, structural analysis of the O-polysaccharide of a representative strain 1B-m revealed a structure that is typical of Proteus O-antigens but is unique in detail. Based on these data, we propose to classify the strains studied as a new serogroup in the genus Proteus named O78."

        "Abstract": "Many microbial pathogens invade and proliferate within host cells and the molecular mechanism underlying this behavior is currently being revealed for several bacterial species. Testing clinically relevant antibacterial compounds and elucidating their effects on gene expression requires adequate controls, especially when studying genetically intractable organisms such as Chlamydia spp., for which various gene fusions cannot be constructed. Until now, relative mRNA levels in Chlamydia have been measured using different internal gene expression controls, including 16S rRNA, mRNAs, and DNA. Here, we compared the advantages and disadvantages of various internal expression controls during the early phase of Chlamydia pneumoniae development. The relative abundance of target mRNAs varied using the different internal control RNAs. This was partly due to variation in the transcript stability of the RNA species. Also, seven out of nine of the analyzed RNAs increased fivefold or more between 2 and 14 h postinfection, while the amount of DNA and number of cells remained essentially unaltered. Our results suggest that RNA should not be used as a gene expression control during the early phase of Chlamydia development, and that intrinsic bacterial DNA is preferable for that purpose because it is stable, abundant, and its relative amount is generally correlated with bacterial numbers."

Here we describe a simple and reproducible transformation system for the filamentous fungus Hypocrea jecorina. The system is based on hxk1 (encoding hexokinase) as selectable marker, a hexokinase-negative strain and D-mannitol, which is used as selective carbon source and osmotic stabilizer. Following transformation with the hxk1 gene, the obtained transformants were able to grow on D-mannitol as sole carbon source. Transformation efficiency achieved using D-mannitol as carbon source and osmotic stabilizer was roughly five times higher than that using D-sorbitol. The utility of this system was further demonstrated by transformation of H. jecorina with the egfp (encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein) gene. Fluorescence microscopy revealed EGFP fluorescence in positive transformants. Our results demonstrated the feasibility of exploiting a carbon source metabolic pathway for the development of promising fungal transformation systems, which provides a new molecular toolbox for genetic modifications of the cell factory H. jecorina."

        "Abstract": "In epileptic patients cyproheptadine is frequently prescribed as an appetite stimulant for the treatment of anorexia associated with anti-epileptic drugs and for the management of 'serotonin syndrome' in depressed epileptic patients. However, the study of serotonergic and histaminergic pathway shows that the decreased neurotransmission of serotonin and histamine in the brain reduces seizures threshold. Since, cyproheptadine interferes with these pathways via antagonizing subtypes of 5-HT(1/2) receptors and H(1) receptor, therefore the present study was undertaken to investigate its effect on seizures threshold, so as to substantiate its use in epileptics. In the present study convulsions were induced in mice by, maximum electroshock (MES), picrotoxin, and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). Cyproheptadine (4 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered per se and along with clinically used anti-epileptic drugs (phenytoin 25 mg/kg, i.p. and diazepam 5 mg/kg, i.p.) in different groups of mice, onset and extent of convulsions in these groups were compared with that of vehicle control and anti-epileptics per se treated groups. Percentage mortality in all groups was also determined. Results depicted a significant increase in duration of tonic hind limb extension in MES and decrease in latency to clonic convulsions induced by PTZ and picrotoxin in cyproheptadine treated groups (per se and along with anti-epileptics), as compared to vehicle control and anti-epileptics per se treated groups respectively. Percentage mortality was also increased with cyproheptadine treatment. Therefore it is concluded that cyproheptadine pretreatment reduces threshold, increases severity of seizures and decreases the efficacy of clinically used anti-epileptic drugs in experimental animal models of convulsions."

        "Abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death in Western countries and will continue to be so in upcoming years. A close correlation has been demonstrated among CVD, stroke, ischemic heart disease, renal failure and a number of modifiable risk factors. As cardiovascular (CV) risk factors commonly co-exist, high-risk patients with hypertension, obesity and diabetes may well benefit from a multiple action combination of CV agents with synergistic efficacy. Control of blood pressure (BP) and the other CV risk factors is still far from the optimal rates and achievement of internationally accepted goals must be imperative. The benefits of achieving these goals, including significant reductions in CV morbidity and mortality, are well documented. Thus, a rigorous effort to improve BP goal attainment is required. Most of the patients will need two or more antihypertensives to achieve BP goal. Administering of two drugs in a single-dose formulation substantially improves patient compliance compared with separate agent administration. Fixed-dose combination therapy can offer potential advantages over individual agents, including increased efficacy, reduced incidence of adverse effects, lower healthcare costs and improved patient compliance through the use of a single medication administered once daily. Currently available fixed-dose agents include several combinations with complementary pharmacodynamic activity. Last, the polypill includes several CV acting agents that affects various CV risk factors and offers encouraging results, although more data are needed to strengthen the polypill concept, its efficacy and safety."

The associated factors with polycythemia were analyzed in the subjects. Excessive polycythemia was defined as hemoglobin concentration over 20 mg/dL.Results:Polycythemia was associated with men, hypoxemia, obesity and high diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in the elderly in Qinghai. Male sex was associated with polycythemia in all ethnicities. Obesity was associated with Han and Tibetan men. Glucose intolerance and activities of daily living were not directly associated with polycythemia after adjustment for sex. There were 7.9% with excessive polycythemia. Independently-associated factors for excessive polycythemia were male sex, body mass index of 25 or more, SpO(2) of less than 85%, DBP of 85 mmHg or more and Han ethnicity (vs Tibetan) by multiple logistic regression.Conclusion:There was a close association of polycythemia with diastolic hypertension and obesity in lifestyle-related diseases in high-altitude elderly people. Han people had a higher hemoglobin concentration after adjustment of lifestyle-related diseases compared with Tibetan people. The difference of hemoglobin concentration may be due to Tibetans undergoing a much longer period of adaptation than Han people. Further study is needed to disclose the association between the difference of hypoxic adaptation, lifestyle-related diseases and chronic mountain sickness for their prevention."

        "Abstract": "Background:Although there are several factors which may contribute to oxidative stress at high altitude, little is known about the association between oxidative stress and aging in the community-dwelling elderly in the Tibetan Plateau.Methods:Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and comprehensive geriatric functions were examined among 235 community-dwelling elderly subjects aged 60 years or more (146 Hans and 89 Tibetans). As a marker of ROS, the levels of reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM) were measured using the d-ROM test.Results:The rate of dependence of basic activities of daily living (basic ADL) among Tibetan elderly highlanders was significantly higher than that among Han elderly highlanders. The d-ROM level was higher among the Tibetan elderly than those among the Han elderly (Tibetan 465.6 +/- 97.9 Carr U, Han 415.3 +/- 72.0 Carr U, P = 0.003). The ROM level was higher among women than those among men. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that being Tibetan, female, and oxygen saturation were independent predictors of increasing d-ROM level (Tibetan beta, 0.241; female beta, 0.206; oxygen saturation beta, 0.218). The high levels of ROM (d-ROM >500 Carr U) were significantly associated with dependence of basic ADL after adjustment for age, sex and ethnicity (odds ratio = 2.51, P = 0.028).Conclusion:The findings of this study imply the possibility that ROS is higher among Tibetan elderly highlanders than that of Han, which related to the geriatric items. Further studies are needed to show the impact of oxidative stress on the aging of highlanders."

Food diversity was determined using an 11-item Food Diversity Score Kyoto (FDSK-11). Subjects were interviewed on health status including activities of daily living (ADL), screening-based depression and quality of life (QOL). Blood chemical investigation was carried out in association with food diversity.Results:ADL was significantly lower in both Han and Tibetan elderly with lower food diversity than those with higher diversity. In Han elderly with lower food diversity, QOL was significantly lower in the items of subjective sense of health, relationship with family and subjective happiness, but not significant in Tibetan elderly. A close association was found between lower food diversity and lower financial satisfaction in both Han and Tibetan subjects. No association was found between food diversity and age or body mass index. Higher food diversity was associated with lower blood glucose level in Han elderly subjects, but the opposite association was found in Tibetan ones.Conclusion:Food diversity was associated with ADL and QOL in highlanders in Qinghai, China. Food assessment is very important as a useful indicator to establish the actual condition of diet and its relation to health status of community-dwelling elderly as well as the change of economic background in the Qinghai highlands."

We wondered if physical complaints of unknown origin were related to oral function.Methods:Five thousand five hundred and eighty-four community residents (2206 men and 3378 women, aged 40-89 years) on the Miyako Islands, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan, were recruited for the baseline study in 1987 and followed up for 15 years. Physical complaints and functional tooth numbers were assessed for the baseline study in 1987 by dentists and followed up for 15 years. Physical complaints of unknown origin included shoulder stiffness, lower back pain, pain of upper extremity, pain of lower extremity, neuralgia, ear ringing, difficult of hearing, dizziness and sleeping difficulties.Results:Physical complaints were significantly associated with functional tooth number in the baseline study. There were no systematic differences between physical complaints and functional tooth number among different age groups. Physical complaints did not influence the survival rates in either men or women.Conclusion:Oral function may be related to physical complaints. Dental care may be one of the targets to treat these physical complaints of unknown origin."

        "Abstract": "Background:Reduced gait speed and stride length are characteristic of gait in elderly people and increase their dependency on assistance. We developed a robotic stride assistance system (SAS) to automatically control the walk ratio during walking. Our aim was to quantify the effects of a walking exercise with the SAS on walking performance and glucose metabolism during walking in community-dwelling elderly adults.Methods:For 3 months, 15 women (72-85 years old) performed the walking exercise twice weekly for 90 min/session. We assessed walking for 5 m at a comfortable speed before and after the intervention. Positron emission tomography with [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was used to assess muscle activity during an unassisted 50-min walk.Results:Walking speed was improved by the intervention and FDG uptake by the gluteus minimus, gluteus medius and rectus femoris, and pelvic muscles (iliacus and gluteus muscles) were reduced.Conclusion:These results suggest that a walking intervention program using an applied robotic system is useful for improving the walking ability and the efficiency of muscle activities during walking in the elderly."

Confirming the possible related anatomy and the clinical significance of awake bruxism in geriatric hospitals is the aim of this study.Methods:We analyzed the medical records of 503 patients who were admitted to hospital from April to June 2008. After the recognition of bruxism, the clinical, brain imaging studies and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) of brain single photon emission computed tomography were performed.Results:In each disease group, five of 125 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients (4.0%), three of 11 frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients (27.3%), seven of 230 stroke patients (including two patients related to citalopram, 3.0%), one of 45 Parkinson's disease patients (2.2%) and four of 17 hydrocephalus patients (23.5%) had bruxism. Even though awake bruxism occurred early after stroke onset, it occurred late after AD and FTD onset. This occurred in a far advanced stage of AD, while it occurred in a moderately advanced stage of FTD. SPM analysis in AD and FTD patients with awake bruxism revealed significant hypoperfusion in frontotemporal and other subcortical structures. Surface electromyography recordings from the masseter muscle showed rhythmic regular motor activity at a rate of 1-2/s.Conclusion:This study suggests that awake bruxism is encountered not infrequently in various diseases in geriatric hospitals. It is frequently observed in FTD and normal pressure hydrocephalus, which characteristically shows frontal lobe dysfunction. These facts and SPM analysis show that awake bruxism can be regarded as a frontal neurological sign of various neurological disorders."

Especially, in elderly patients, severe hyponatremia is sporadically developed without any complaints. Although a variety of causes of hyponatremia are documented, diagnosis of functional adrenal insufficiency is difficult because of a lack of the diagnostic criteria. In this case report, we present five cases of hyponatremia in the elderly, who were presumed to have functional adrenal insufficiency, successfully treated with low doses of hydrocortisone."

We describe an elderly case with peripheral T-cell lymphoma-unspecified (PTCL) presenting as diffuse myelofibrosis. Bone marrow biopsy revealed infiltration of atypical lymphocytes and diffuse myelofibrosis without any increase in megakaryocytes. To discuss the pathogenesis of fibrosis, we examined cytokines relative to fibrosis using immunostaining. The expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was diffusely detected in the area of extracellular matrix of bone marrow. In addition, in situ hybridization revealed that infiltrating lymphoma cells expressed bFGF mRNA. Basic FGF, originally identified based on its mitogenicity for fibroblasts, has multiple potential, influencing neoangiogenesis, bone marrow fibrosis and the proliferation of tumor cells. Basic FGF might play an important role in the pathogenesis of myelofibrosis in the present case."

For each year, we examined the estimated total national expenditure, the total number of U.S. adults who received chiropractic care, the total number of ambulatory visits to U.S. chiropractors, and the inflation-adjusted charges and expenditures per U.S. adult chiropractic patient.Principal findings:The total number of U.S. adults who visited a chiropractor increased 57 percent from 7.7 million in 2000 to 12.1 million in 2003. From 1997 to 2006, the inflation-adjusted national expenditures on chiropractic care increased 56 percent from U.S.$3.8 billion to U.S.$5.9 billion. Inflation-adjusted total mean expenditures per patient and expenditures per office visit remained unchanged.Conclusion:The large increase in U.S. adult expenditures on chiropractic care between 1997 and 2006 was due to a 57 percent increase in the total number of U.S. adult chiropractic patients that occurred from 2000 to 2003. From 2003 to 2006, the total number of U.S. adult chiropractic patients has remained stable."

Unadjusted in-hospital AMI mortality for Medicare enrollees in specialty and general hospitals was 6.1 and 10.1 percent (p<.0001) and for non-Medicare enrollees was 2.8 and 4.0 percent (p<.04). Unadjusted in-hospital CABG mortality for Medicare enrollees in specialty and general hospitals was 3.2 and 4.7 percent (p<.01) and for non-Medicare enrollees was 1.1 and 1.8 percent (p=.02). After adjusting for patient characteristics and hospital volume, risk-standardized in-hospital mortality for all AMI patients was 2.7 percent for specialty hospitals and 4.1 percent for general hospitals (p<.001) and for CABG was 1.5 percent for specialty hospitals and 2.0 percent for general hospitals (p=.07).Conclusions:In-hospital mortality in specialty hospitals was lower than in general hospitals for AMI but similar for CABG. Our results suggest that specialty hospitals may offer significantly better outcomes for AMI but not CABG."

For each subject, we obtained claims data for every prescription filled between January 1, 2005, and April 31, 2007.Study design:Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the experience of a \"treatment\" group (dual eligibles between 65 and 78 years on January 1, 2005) with that of a \"control\" group (near-elderly patients with Medicaid coverage between 60 and 63 years on January 1, 2005) during the first 18 months after Part D implementation.Principal findings:Expenditures for the treatment and control groups tracked each other closely in the pre-Part D period. Immediately following the implementation of Part D, expenditures for both groups decreased and then leveled off. There were no significant changes in trends in the dual eligibles' out-of-pocket expenditures, total monthly expenditures, pill-days, or total number of prescriptions due to Part D.Conclusions:We find no evidence that Part D adversely affected pharmaceutical utilization or out-of-pocket expenditures of dual eligibles during the transition period, nor during the 16 months subsequent to Part D implementation."

Histologically, 13 cases (65%) consisted of large cell lymphoma and seven (35%) were of medium-sized cells. Intraepithelial lymphoma cell invasion was found in three cases (15%). Two of 10 surgical cases (20%) showed intramucosal tumour cell spreading with enteropathy-like features. Helicobacter pylori CagA gene was detected in three of 10 cases (30%). The lymphoma cells of all 20 cases were positive for CD3 and/or TCRbetaF1 and negative for CD56. CD4- and CD8- lymphoma was found in 11 cases (55%), CD4+ lymphoma in seven (35%) and CD8+ lymphoma in two (10%). CD30+, CD5+ and CD25+ lymphomas were detected in nine (45%), 10 (50%) and 11 (55%) cases, respectively. Five-year survival of the 16 available cases was 54%. Early clinical stage and medium-sized cell lymphoma were significantly (P < 0.05) better prognostic factors.Conclusions:Patients with GTCL exhibit distinct clinicopathological findings and prognoses from those with enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphomas.

Pathological and clinical features were compared among the groups. In oncocytes, densely packed mitochondria resulted in homogeneous immunolabelling of basal cytoplasmic regions, whereas ER and the nuclei were typically displaced to the apical position. This aberrant organelle distribution was not observed in non-oncocytes, which allowed reliable distinction between oncocytic and mitochondrion-rich lesions. Clinically, mitochondrial increase in non-oncocytic lesions was associated with neoplasia, malignancy and higher cancer recurrence rates. Similar correlation, albeit less pronounced, was observed within the oncocytic tumour group. By contrast, oncocytic change per se was not associated with neoplasia, malignancy or cancer aggressiveness.Conclusions:True oncocytic neoplasms can be distinguished from mitochondrion-rich non-oncocytic tumours based on aberrant distribution of all major cell organelles. This distinction has immediate clinical relevance and should be implemented in practice."

The aim was to find an immunohistochemical marker to improve the diagnosis of chromophobe RCC.Methods and results:The expression profile of renal cell tumours was established using the Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 microarray. After performing hierarchical clustering we selected the best 50 genes and analysed 24 of them by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. TMC5, RBM35, SPINK7, CD82/KAI1 and GLIS3 were expressed specifically in chromophobe RCCs. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed the specificity of CD82/KAI1. Analysis of tissue microarrays containing all major types of renal neoplasm revealed immunopositivity for CD82/KAI1 in 78% (69/88) of chromophobe RCCs but in only 3% (6/220) of conventional or clear cell RCCs. All 90 ROs and 171 papillary RCCs were immunonegative for CD82/KAI1. To confirm the specificity of antibody by immunoblotting, we transfected HEK293 cells with an expression vector containing the full-length CD82/KAI1.Conclusions:CD82/KAI1 is an excellent marker for distinguishing chromophobe RCCs from other types of renal cell tumours, especially from ROs with overlapping phenotype."

RAD51 protein expression in the cytoplasm and nuclei of the benign tissues was significantly less than in the malignant tissues (P < 0.001). In all cancers, cytoplasmic expression of RAD51 was more prevalent and associated with higher Gleason score (P < 0.05) irrespective of BRCA mutational status, than its expression in benign tissues (P < 0.001). Although nuclear immunoreactivity was not observed in BRCA-associated cancers with Gleason score < or =7, it was significantly increased in all other groups of prostatic cancers when compared with benign tissues (P < 0.001).Conclusions:RAD51 protein is strongly expressed in high-grade prostatic cancers, whether sporadic or associated with BRCA germ-line mutations. Distinct localization of RAD51 between cytoplasm and nucleus, particularly in cancers of Gleason score < or =7, reflects distinct levels of RAD51 regulatory activity, from transcription to DNA repair. This biomarker may be of value in identifying patients requiring urgent treatment at diagnosis as well as in analysing biological mechanisms underlying aggressive phenotype of human prostatic cancer."

        "Abstract": "Aims:The molecular signature of alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a specific der(17)t(X;17)(p11.2;q25) translocation, resulting in a chimeric transcription factor (ASPSCR1-TFE3). When this disease is no longer amenable to surgical curative intervention, uniformly efficacious therapies are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of potential molecular therapeutic targets in a cohort of ASPS tumour samples.Methods and results:Immunohistochemical analysis for hepatocyte growth factor, c-Met, phosphorylated c-Met, phosphorylated AKT, phosphorylated MEK, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), p53 and vimentin was performed on an ASPS tissue microarray, yielding complete data from 26 tumours. Activation of c-Met and its downstream effectors was noted, whereas only limited EGFR expression was seen. VEGF was expressed to varying degrees. Only one sample exhibited strong nuclear p53 expression, while 10 expressed low levels. Vimentin expression was negative in the vast majority of samples (96%).Conclusions:There is a crucial need for better anti-ASPS therapies. Activated c-Met and the phosphorylation of its downstream effectors validate an intact signalling cascade probably induced by the ASPSCR1-TFE3 chimeric transcription factor. The angiogenic phenotype of these tumours is supported by increased angiogenic factor expression. Combination therapies targeting both tumour cells and angiogenesis merit further investigation."

        "Abstract": "Objectives:To study determinants of late HIV diagnosis in a low-HIV-prevalence (<0.1%) country where HIV spread among men who have sex with men (MSM) and heterosexuals in the 1980s, and among injecting drug users (IDUs) in the late 1990s.Methods:Newly diagnosed HIV cases referred to the Helsinki University Central Hospital between 1985 and 2005 were reviewed to identify determinants of late HIV diagnosis, defined as diagnosis when the first CD4 count was <200 cells/microL, or when AIDS occurred within 3 months of HIV diagnosis. Determinants of late diagnosis were analysed using multivariate logistic regression.Results:Among 934 HIV cases, 211 (23%) were diagnosed late. In the first 4-year interval of each sub-epidemic (1985-1989 for MSM and heterosexuals, 1998-2001 for IDUs), rates of late HIV diagnosis were 13%, 18% and 6%, respectively, but increased thereafter to 29%, 27% and 37%. Late diagnosis was associated with non-Finnish ethnicity, older age, male gender, lack of earlier HIV testing, diagnosis at health care settings and later stage of the sub-epidemic.Conclusions:The lower rate of late diagnosis in the first 4-year interval of each HIV sub-epidemic suggests that the early stages of the HIV epidemic in Finland were detected early. This factor may have contributed to the low prevalence of HIV infection in Finland. The stage and age of the epidemic should be taken into account when interpreting the data on late HIV diagnosis, especially in cross-country comparisons."

Participants having > or =3 month gap in HAART coverage were defined as having a TI. Cox proportional hazards modelling was used to examine factors associated with TIs and to examine factors associated with resumption of treatment.Results:A total of 1707 participants were study eligible and 643 (37.7%) experienced TIs. TIs within 1 year of ART initiation decreased from 29% of individuals in 2000 to 19% in 2006 (P<0.001). TIs were independently associated with a history of injection drug use (IDU) (P=0.02), higher baseline CD4 cell counts (P<0.001), hepatitis C co-infection (P<0.001) and the use of nelfinavir (NFV) (P=0.04) or zidovudine (ZDV)/lamivudine (3TC) (P=0.009) in the primary HAART regimen. Male gender (P<0.001), older age (P<0.001), AIDS at baseline (P=0.008) and having a physician who had prescribed HAART to fewer patients (P=0.03) were protective against TIs. Four hundred and eighty-eight (71.9%) participants eventually restarted ART with male patients and those who developed an AIDS-defining illness prior to their TI more likely to restart therapy. Higher CD4 cell counts at the time of TI and unknown hepatitis C status were associated with a reduced likelihood of restarting ART.Conclusion:Treatment interruptions were associated with younger, less ill, female and IDU participants. Most participants with interruptions eventually restarted therapy. Interruptions occurred less frequently in recent years."

The primary objective of this study was to determine hospitalization rates over time in the year after HAART initiation for virological responders and nonresponders.Methods:Hospitalizations among 1327 HAART-naïve subjects in an urban HIV clinic in 1997-2007 were examined before and after HAART initiation. Hospitalization rates were stratified by virological responders (> or =1 log(10) decrease in HIV-1 RNA within 6 months after HAART initiation) and nonresponders. Causes were determined through International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) codes and chart review. Multivariate negative binomial regression was used to assess factors associated with hospitalization.Results:During the first 45 days after HAART initiation, the hospitalization rate of responders was similar to their pre-HAART baseline rate [75.1 vs. 78.8/100 person-years (PY)] and to the hospitalization rate of nonresponders during the first 45 days (79.4/100 PY). The hospitalization rate of responders fell significantly between 45 and 90 days after HAART initiation and reached a plateau at approximately 45/100 PY from 91 to 365 days after HAART initiation. Significant decreases were seen in hospitalizations for opportunistic and nonopportunistic infections.Conclusions:The first substantial clinical benefit from HAART may be realized by 90 days after HAART initiation; providers should keep close vigilance at least until this time."

Twenty-eight subjects were randomized to 0.7 mg/day rhGH, and 18 subjects to placebo, administered as daily subcutaneous injections between 1 and 3 pm for 40 weeks. Endpoints included changes in visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), limb fat mass, percentage of limb fat, plasma lipids, insulin resistance and glucose tolerance.Results:VAT and trunk fat mass decreased significantly in the GH group compared with the placebo group [-19 cm(2) (-11%) vs. 12 cm(2) (6%), P=0.03, and -548 g (-9%) vs. 353 g (6%), P<0.01, respectively]. The beneficial fat redistribution in the GH group occurred without concomitant changes in subcutaneous fat at the abdomen or extremities. rhGH therapy was well tolerated. Insulin resistance, glucose tolerance, and total plasma cholesterol and triglycerides did not significantly change during intervention.Conclusions:Daily 0.7 mg rhGH treatment for 40 weeks reduced abdominal visceral fat and trunk fat mass in HIV-infected patients.

Accurate high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol values are necessary for the management of these abnormalities, but current methods have not been properly assessed in these patients. The aim of this study was to assess in HIV-infected patients the consistency and accuracy of a synthetic polymer/detergent homogeneous assay used to measure HDL cholesterol concentrations and to evaluate the impact of storage.Methods:HDL cholesterol was measured using a synthetic polymer/detergent homogeneous method in samples from HIV-infected patients and healthy subjects for each of the storage regimens: baseline, after 1 week at 4 degrees C, and after 12 months at -80 degrees C. The ultracentrifugation and precipitation assays were used for comparison.Results:Three out of every 20 samples from HIV-infected patients had discrepant HDL cholesterol values with respect to the ultracentrifugation method. Overestimation was associated with high C-reactive protein concentrations and underestimation with plasma gamma-globulin concentrations, an effect that was amplified by any of the storage conditions tested.Conclusions:Caution is needed when using the synthetic polymer/detergent homogeneous method for direct measurement of HDL cholesterol concentrations in HIV-infected patients. This assay is of limited use in clinical trials in which frozen samples are analysed."

Each 'drug coverage-viral load episode' (DCVL episode) was defined as a 6-month period immediately prior to a VL < or =50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL (time-zero), during which the patient had been continuously on HAART, with all measured VLs < or =50 copies/mL. The next VL after time-zero was used to assess whether VL rebound (defined as >200 copies/mL) had occurred. Drug coverage, our measure of adherence, was calculated as the proportion of days in the 6-month period covered by a valid prescription for at least three antiretroviral drugs.Results:A total of 376 (2.4%) VL rebounds occurred in 15 660 DCVL episodes among 1632 patients. Drug coverage was 100% for 32% of episodes, 95-99% for 16% of episodes and < or =60% for 10% of episodes. The risk ratio of rebound associated with a 10% increase in drug coverage, adjusted for potential confounding variables, was 0.93 (95% confidence interval 0.88-0.98).Conclusions:Antiretroviral drug coverage assessed at the time of VL measurement in patients with undetectable VL is potentially clinically useful for predicting VL rebound at the next VL measurement."

Participants were given an anonymous questionnaire which included questions pertaining to demography, SCL-90 and psychosocial experiences.Results:The mean subscale scores for SCL-90 in the HIV-positive group were all higher than those of the control group (P<0.001), especially for depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and hostility. Female HIV-positive individuals had significantly higher depression and anxiety scores (P<0.05) and more scores higher than 2.0 than male HIV-positive individuals. The average number of subscales with mean scores higher than 2.0 was 4.1 for female HIV-positive individuals and 3.7 for male HIV-positive individuals. The most common psychosocial experiences related to HIV infection were fear (36.9%) and helplessness (31.8%). 90.2% of HIV-positive people would not tell others about their disease because of fear of discrimination against family members (42.2%), exclusion by community members (26.9%) and abandonment (23.3%). Discrimination from acquaintances (38.8%) was a main stressor in the HIV-positive individuals' daily life. Most members of HIV-positive individuals' communities expressed negative attitudes: alienation, coldness, aversion and fear. 38.3% of the HIV-positive participants reported that their family members had been discriminated against.Conclusions:The results demonstrate that HIV-positive people in eastern China live in a negative psychosocial environment and suffer from psychological distress. It is necessary to provide psychological interventions for people living with AIDS and to educate community members in order to improve the psychosocial environment."

Small changes in PB can greatly impact the fraction of drug unbound (FU) exerting pharmacological effect. We report lopinavir (LPV) PB during third trimester (antepartum, AP) compared to > or =1.7 weeks postpartum (PP) to determine if FU changes compensate for reduced total concentrations reported previously.Methods:P1026s enrolled women receiving LPV/ritonavir, soft gel capsules 400/100 mg or 533/133 mg twice daily. LPV FU, albumin and AAG were determined AP and PP.Results:AP/PP samples were available from 29/25 women respectively with all but one woman receiving the same dose AP/PP. LPV FU was increased 18% AP vs. PP (mean 0.96+/-0.16% AP vs. 0.82+/-0.21% PP, P=0.001). Mean protein concentrations were reduced AP (AAG=477 mg/L; albumin=3.28 mg/dL) vs. PP (AAG=1007 mg/L; albumin=3.85 mg/dL) (P<0.0001 for each comparison). AAG concentration correlated with LPV binding. Total LPV concentration did not correlate with LPV FU AP or PP. However, higher LPV concentration PP was associated with reduced PB and higher FU after adjustment for AAG.Conclusions:LPV FU was higher and AAG lower AP vs. PP. The 18% increase in LPV FU AP is smaller than the reduction in total LPV concentration reported previously and is not of sufficient magnitude to eliminate the need for an increased dose during pregnancy."

        "Abstract": "The human chemokine receptor CRAM (chemokine receptor on activated macrophages), encoded by the gene CCRL2, is a new candidate for the atypical chemokine receptor family that includes the receptors DARC, D6 and chemocentryx chemokine receptor (CCX-CKR). CRAM is maturation-stage-dependently expressed on human B lymphocytes and its surface expression is up-regulated upon short-term CCL5 exposure. Here, we demonstrate that the homeostatic chemokine CCL19 is a specific ligand for CRAM. In radioactive labelling studies CCL19 bound to CRAM-expressing cells with an affinity similar to the described binding of its other receptor CCR7. In contrast to the known CCL19/CCR7 ligand/receptor pair, CRAM stimulation by CCL19 did not result in typical chemokine-receptor-dependent cellular activation like calcium mobilization or migration. Instead, we demonstrate that CRAM is constitutively recycling via clathrin-coated pits and able to internalize CCL19 as well as anti-CRAM antibodies. As this absence of classical chemokine receptor responses and the recycling and internalization features are characteristic for non-classical chemokine receptors, we suggest that CRAM is the newest member of this group. As CCL19 is known to be critically involved in lymphocyte and dendritic cell trafficking, CCL19-binding competition by CRAM might be involved in modulating these processes."

        "Abstract": "T cells recognize antigen via the T-cell receptor (TCR) and produce a spectrum of responses that range from activation to anergy or cell death. The variety of outcomes may be dictated by the strength of the signals transmitted upon cognate recognition of the TCR. The physiological outcome of TCR engagement is determined by several factors, including the avidity of the ligand for TCR, the duration of engagement, and the presence and nature of accessory molecules present on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). In this review, we discuss a model of anergy induced by presentation of low densities of peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) ligand in CD4(+) T cells and compare it to anergy induced by altered peptide ligands in an effort to identify a unifying mechanism. We suggest that altered peptide ligand (APL) and low densities of agonist ligands induce anergy by engaging less than optimal numbers of TCRs. The physiological impacts of anergy in memory CD4(+) T cells are discussed."

        "Abstract": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are germline-encoded innate immune receptors that recognize invading micro-organisms and induce immune and inflammatory responses. Deregulation of TLRs is known to be closely linked to various immune disorders and inflammatory diseases. Cells at sites of inflammation are exposed to hypoxic stress, which further aggravates inflammatory processes. We have examined if hypoxic stress modulates the TLR activity of macrophages. Hypoxia and CoCl(2) (a hypoxia mimetic) enhanced the expression of TLR4 messenger RNA and protein in macrophages (RAW264.7 cells), whereas the messenger RNA of other TLRs was not increased. To determine the underlying mechanism, we investigated the role of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) in the regulation of TLR4 expression. Knockdown of HIF-1alpha expression by small interfering RNA inhibited hypoxia-induced and CoCl(2)-induced TLR4 expression in macrophages, while over-expression of HIF-1alpha potentiated TLR4 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that HIF-1alpha binds to the TLR4 promoter region under hypoxic conditions. In addition, deletion or mutation of a putative HIF-1-binding motif in the TLR4 promoter greatly attenuated HIF-1alpha-induced TLR4 promoter reporter expression. Up-regulation of TLR4 expression by hypoxic stress enhanced the response of macrophages to lipopolysaccharide, resulting in increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-6, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted, and interferon-inducible protein-10. These results demonstrate that TLR4 expression in macrophages is up-regulated via HIF-1 in response to hypoxic stress, suggesting that hypoxic stress at sites of inflammation enhances susceptibility to subsequent infection and inflammatory signals by up-regulating TLR4."

        "Abstract": "The lectin pathway of complement is activated upon binding of mannan-binding lectin (MBL) or ficolins (FCNs) to their targets. Upon recognition of targets, the MBL-and FCN-associated serine proteases (MASPs) are activated, allowing them to generate the C3 convertase C4b2a. Recent findings indicate that the MASPs also activate components of the coagulation system. We have previously shown that MASP-1 has thrombin-like activity whereby it cleaves and activates fibrinogen and factor XIII. MASP-2 has factor Xa-like activity and activates prothrombin through cleavage to form thrombin. We now report that purified L-FCN-MASPs complexes, bound from serum to N-acetylcysteine-Sepharose, or MBL-MASPs complexes, bound to mannan-agarose, generate clots when incubated with calcified plasma or purified fibrinogen and factor XIII. Plasmin digestion of the clot and analysis using anti-D-dimer antibodies revealed that the clot was made up of fibrin and was similar to that generated by thrombin in normal human plasma. Fibrinopeptides A and B (FPA and FPB, respectively) were released after fibrinogen cleavage by L-FCN-MASPs complexes captured on N-acetylcysteine-Sepharose. Studies of inhibition of fibrinopeptide release indicated that the dominant pathway for clotting catalysed by the MASPs is via MASP-2 and prothrombin activation, as hirudin, a thrombin inhibitor that does not inhibit MASP-1 and MASP-2, substantially inhibits fibrinopeptide release. In the light of their potent chemoattractant effects on neutrophil and fibroblast recruitment, the MASP-mediated release of FPA and FPB may play a role in early immune activation. Additionally, MASP-catalysed deposition and polymerization of fibrin on the surface of micro-organisms may be protective by limiting the dissemination of infection."

        "Abstract": "The immature immune system requires constant stimulation by foreign antigens during the early stages of life to develop properly and to create efficient immune responses against later infections. We have previously shown that intake of antigenic dietary protein is critical for inducing maturation of the immune system as well as for the development of T helper type 1 (Th1) immunity. In this study, we show that administration of an amino acid (aa)-based diet during the development of the immune system subsequently resulted in inefficient control of Leishmania major infection in adult C57BL/6 mice. Compared with mice fed a control protein-containing diet, adult aa-fed mice showed a decreased interferon (IFN)-gamma response to parasite antigens and insufficient production of nitric oxide (NO), which is crucial to parasite death. However, no deviation towards Th2-specific immunity to L. major was observed. Phenotypic analysis of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) from aa-fed mice revealed deficient levels of the costimulatory molecules CD40 and CD80, and low levels of interleukin (IL)-12 produced by peritoneal macrophages, revealing an early stage of maturation of these cells. APCs isolated from aa-fed mice were unable to stimulate a Th1 response in vitro. Both phenotypic features of T cells from aa-fed mice and their ability to produce a Th1 response in the presence of mature APCs were unaffected when compared with T cells from control mice. The results presented here support the notion that regulation of Th1 immunity to infection includes environmental factors such as dietary proteins, which provide a natural source of stimulation that contributes to the process of maturation of APCs."

We tested the hypothesis that HIV during pregnancy affects the ability of CD4 T cells of HIV-negative infants to respond to vaccine challenge by recruiting HIV-negative infants born to HIV-negative and HIV-positive mothers and measuring their responses to Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine given at birth. At 2 weeks, maternal HIV status did not influence CD4 T-cell counts or differentiation, but by 10 weeks CD4 counts of infants born to HIV-positive mothers fell to a level characteristic of HIV-positive infants. Among the CD4 T-cell populations, markers of differentiation (CCR7(-) CD45RA(-) CD27(-)) and senescence (CD57, PD-1) were more common among infants born to HIV-positive mothers than among infants born to HIV-negative mothers. At 2 weeks of age, we assessed the effector response to heat-killed BCG and tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) by overnight interferon (IFN)-gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot-forming cell assay (ELISpot), but found no measurable effect of maternal HIV status. At 10 weeks, we assessed CD4 T-cell memory by measuring proliferation in response to the same antigens. We observed a bimodal response that allowed infants to be classified as high or low responders and found that fewer infants born to HIV-positive mothers were able to mount a robust proliferative response, suggesting that their reduced CD4 counts and increased differentiation indicated a deficiency in their ability to develop immunological memory."

        "Abstract": "Neutrophils make up an essential part of the innate immune system, and are involved both in the initial responses to pathogens, and in orchestrating later immune responses. Neutrophils recognize pathogens through pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which are activated by microbial motifs. The Nod-like receptors (nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat containing family; NLRs) constitute a recently discovered group of PRRs whose role in the neutrophil immune responses is not yet characterized. The present study aimed to investigate the expression and function of NLRs in neutrophils. Neutrophils were isolated from human peripheral blood, and the presence of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1), NOD2 and NACHT-LRR-PYD-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) was evaluated with flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. The expression of NOD1, NOD2 and NLRP3 messenger RNA was determined using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Changes in neutrophil cytokine secretion, phenotype and migration following agonist-induced activation were studied using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, flow cytometry and a chemotaxis assay, respectively. No expression of NOD1 was found in isolated neutrophils and stimulation with the NOD1 ligand gamma-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid induced no signs of activity. In contrast, a marked expression of NOD2 and NLRP3 was found. NOD2 activation with MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoGln (MDP) resulted in interleukin-8 secretion, CD62 ligand down-regulation, CD11b up-regulation and increased migration towards an inflammatory stimulus. NLRP3 activation with alum caused interleukin-1beta secretion and facilitated migration. Altogether, this suggests that NLRs may be a previously unknown pathway for neutrophil activation."

Although invasive aspergillosis is one of the most severe human fungal infections, little is known regarding the relative importance of the Th1 versus Th17 cellular immune pathways for the human anti-Aspergillus host defence. Using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and a system consisting of monocyte-derived macrophages with lymphocytes, we found that Aspergillus fumigatus is a weak inducer of human IL-17 but induces a strong Th1 response. These data were validated by the very low IL-17 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum of patients with invasive aspergillosis. Surprisingly, live A. fumigatus reduced IL-17 production induced by mitogenic stimuli. This effect was mediated through the propensity of A. fumigatus to metabolize tryptophan and release kynurenine, which modulates the inflammatory response through inhibition of IL-17 production. In conclusion, A. fumigatus does not stimulate production of IL-17 and human host defence against aspergillosis may not rely on potent Th17 responses."

        "Abstract": "This study employs a numerical model to investigate the dispersion characteristics of human exhaled droplets in ventilation rooms. The numerical model is validated by two different experiments prior to the application for the studied cases. Some typical questions on studying dispersion of human exhaled droplets indoors are reviewed and numerical study using the normalized evaporation time and normalized gravitational sedimentation time was performed to obtain the answers. It was found that modeling the transient process from a droplet to a droplet nucleus due to evaporation can be neglected when the normalized evaporation time is <0.051. When the normalized gravitational sedimentation time is <0.005, the influence of ventilation rate could be neglected. However, the influence of ventilation pattern and initial exhaled velocity on the exhaled droplets dispersion is dominant as the airflow decides the droplets dispersion significantly. Besides, the influence of temperature and relative humidity on the dispersion of droplets can be neglected for the droplet with initial diameter <200 microm; while droplet nuclei size plays an important role only for the droplets with initial diameter within the range of 10 microm-100 microm. Practical Implications Dispersion of human exhaled droplets indoor is a key issue when evaluating human exposure to infectious droplets. Results from detailed numerical studies in this study reveal how the evaporation of droplets, ventilation rate, airflow pattern, initial exhaled velocity, and particle component decide the droplet dispersion indoor. The detailed analysis of these main influencing factors on droplet dispersion in ventilation rooms may help to guide (1) the selection of numerical approach, e.g., if the transient process from a droplet to a droplet nucleus due to evaporation should be incorporated to study droplet dispersion, and (2) the selection of ventilation system to minimize the spread of pathogen-laden droplets in an indoor environment."

Indoor and outdoor PM2.5 and PM10 mass concentrations and elemental composition were determined using an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. Quantitative information was obtained on mass concentrations and other characteristics such as seasonal variation, indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratio, PM2.5/PM10 ratio, correlations and sources. Average indoor and outdoor PM2.5 concentrations were 29.8 and 23.5 microg/m(3) for the summer period, and 24.4 and 21.8 microg/m(3) for the winter period, respectively. Average indoor and outdoor PM10 concentrations were 45.5 and 59.9 microg/m(3) for the summer period, and 56.9 and 102.3 microg/m(3) for the winter period, respectively. A varimax rotated factor analysis (FA) was performed separately on indoor and outdoor datasets in an effort to identify possible heavy metal sources of PM2.5 and PM10 particle fractions. FA of outdoor data produced source categories comprising polluted soil, industry, motor vehicles, and fossil fuel combustion for both PM fractions, while source categories determined for indoor data for both PM2.5 and PM10 comprised industry, polluted soil, motor vehicles, and smoking, with an additional source category of cooking activities detected for the PM2.5 fraction. Practical Implications In buildings close to industrial areas or traffic arteries, outdoor sources may have an important effect on indoor air pollution. Therefore, indoor and outdoor investigations should be conducted simultaneously to assess the relationship between indoor and outdoor pollution. This study presents the simultaneous measurement of PM fractions (PM2.5 and PM10) and their elemental compositions to determine the sources of respirable PM and the heavy metals bound to these particles in indoor air. Factor analysis of indoor data indicated that the contribution of outdoor pollutant sources to indoor pollution was about 70%, making these sources the most significant for indoor heavy metal pollution, wheras other sources of indoor pollution included smoking and cooking activities."

It has been demonstrated that innovative operating concepts that make use of natural ventilation seem to be more appreciated by occupants. Among the available ventilation strategies that are currently available, buoyancy driven, single-sided natural ventilation has proved to be very effective and can provide high air change rates for temperature and Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) control. However, to promote a wider distribution of these systems an improvement in the knowledge of their working principles is necessary. The present study analyses and presents the results of an experimental evaluation of airing performance in terms of ventilation characteristics, IAQ and thermal comfort. It includes investigations of the consequences of opening time, opening frequency, opening area and expected airflow rate, ventilation efficiency, thermal comfort and dynamic temperature conditions. A suitable laboratory test rig was developed to perform extensive experimental analyses of the phenomenon under controlled and repeatable conditions. The results showed that short-term window airing is very effective and can provide both acceptable IAQ and thermal comfort conditions in buildings. Practical Implications This study gives the necessary background and in-depth knowledge of the performance of window airing by single-sided natural ventilation necessary for the development of control strategies for window airing (length of opening period and opening frequency) for optimum IAQ and thermal comfort in naturally ventilated buildings."

A cDNA encoding the cathepsin L-like proteinase Ha-cathL has been cloned from Helicoverpa armigera. It has a sequence of 1826 bp and encodes a 550-residue protein with a molecular mass of 63 kDa. Northern blot analysis indicated that Ha-cathL is specifically expressed in haemocytes, with increased expression during larval moulting and metamorphosis. In vivo experimentation revealed that Ha-cathL is up-regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone. Meanwhile, in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry revealed that Ha-cathL mRNA is mainly expressed in granulocytes and plasmatocytes. Knock down of cathepsin L by RNA interference results in larvae death before pupation or the formation of a chimeric pupa containing a larval head and thorax, abnormal wings and the pupal abdomen. The reason for this is that the affected haemocytes cannot become granulated, and therefore cannot participate in fat body remodelling and wing development. These facts suggest that Ha-cathL is involved in larval moulting and metamorphosis by participating in the functioning of haemocytes."

The PubMed database was used initially; the reference list for smear layer featured 1277 articles, and for both smear layer dentine and smear layer root canal revealed 1455 publications. Smear layer endodontics disclosed 408 papers. A forward search was undertaken on selected articles and using some author names. Potentially relevant material was also sought in contemporary endodontic texts, whilst older books revealed historic information and primary research not found electronically, such that this paper does not represent a 'classical' review. Data obtained suggests that smear layer removal should enhance canal disinfection. Current methods of smear removal include chemical, ultrasonic and laser techniques - none of which are totally effective throughout the length of all canals or are universally accepted. If smear is to be removed, the method of choice seems to be the alternate use of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and sodium hypochlorite solutions. Conflict remains regarding the removal of the smear layer before filling root canals, with investigations required to determine the role of the smear layer in the outcomes of root canal treatment."

After extraction, the actual location of the minor foramen was determined visually and with magnification. A paired samples t-test, chi-square test and a repeated measure anova at the 0.05 level of significance were used to determine differences between the groups.Results:The Root ZX located the minor foramen correctly 68% of the time in anterior and premolar teeth, and 58% of the time in molar teeth. The Elements-Diagnostic located the minor foramen correctly 58% of the time in anterior and premolar teeth and 49% of the time in molar teeth. Radiographs located the minor foramen correctly 20% of the time in anterior and premolar teeth and 11% of the time in molar teeth. There was no statistically significant difference between the two locators, but there was a significant difference between them and radiographs. For all teeth, the measurements made by the apex locators were within +/-0.5 mm of the minor foramen 100% of the time, whereas for the radiographs, the measurements were within this range only 15% of the time. This difference was significant (P = 0.05).Conclusion:Measuring the location of the minor foramen using the two apex locators was more accurate than radiographs and would reduce the risk of instrumenting and filling beyond the apical foramen."

The six groups were: (1) saline; (2) 5% NaOCl; (3) 3% NaOCl; (4) 17% EDTA; (5) 3% NaOCl and 17% EDTA; (6) 5% NaOCl and 17% EDTA. All groups underwent four (group 1) or five (groups 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) sequential 30-min irrigation periods following each of which the tooth was subjected to a standard regime of cyclic, nondestructive, occlusal loading. Tooth surface strain was measured during each loading cycle using electrical strain gauges mounted cervico-proximally. The data were analysed by Hierarchical anova and post hoc multiple comparisons.Results:Irrigation with 5% NaOCl alone or alternating with 17% EDTA significantly (P < 0.001) increased the peak strain values for each of the irrigation periods compared with that of saline (group 1). The data for the other groups revealed no significant differences compared with those of saline. The strain increase after the fourth irrigation cycle was significantly higher for group 6 than for group 2. The measured canal morphology and dentine thickness parameters did not prove to have a significant effect on tooth surface strain.Conclusions:Irrigation with 5% NaOCl acting alone or alternated with 17% EDTA (used in 30 min cycles), significantly increased tooth surface strain. The alternated regimen showed significantly greater changes in tooth surface strain than NaOCl alone. Irrigation with 3% NaOCl and 17% EDTA individually or in combination did not significantly alter the tooth surface strain."

The resin tags were evaluated from slices obtained from sections perpendicular to the long axis of the teeth at 3, 6, and 9 mm from the root apex under a Confocal Laser Scanning microscope.Results:In all groups, lack of continuity of resin tag length, density and quality was observed not only from the cervical to the apical region of each root canal, but also in a mesio-distal direction to the long axis of the root. Application of etch & rinse adhesive in contrast to the self-etch adhesives provided the formation of the shorter, but considerably denser, more homogeneous and not interrupted resin tags with similar length. Use of the activator for all types of adhesives significantly increased the completeness (P = 0.014) and continuity (P = 0.024) of resin tags.Conclusions:None of the investigated adhesives were able to completely infiltrate the dentinal tubules in the entire root canal.

Five haemostatic modalities were tested for their haemostatic effect and tissue reactions, and were compared with untreated control defects: Expasyl + Stasis, Expasyl + Stasi + freshening of the bone defect with a bur, Spongostan, Spongostan+ epinephrine, and electro cauterization. The haemostatic effect was analysed visually and compared using Wilcoxon's signed rank test. Two groups of three animals were evaluated histologically for hard and soft tissue reactions related to the different haemostatic measures, after 3 and 12 weeks of healing respectively.Results:Expasyl + Stasis and electro cauterization proved most effective in reducing bleeding (P < 0.05), but were accompanied by unfavourable tissue reactions, as indicated by the presence of necrotic bone, inflammatory cells and the absence of bone repair. These adverse tissue reactions did not recover substantially over time. However, adverse reactions were not observed when the superficial layer of bone had been removed with a rotary instrument. In contrast, Spongostan + epinephrine showed only a moderate haemostatic effect, but elicited also only mild adverse tissue reactions.Conclusions:Haemostasis in experimental bone defects is most effectively accomplished by using Expasyl + Stasis or electro cauterization. However, the bone defects should be freshened with a rotary instrument before suturing so as not to compromise healing."

Treatment strategies for traumatized, immature teeth should aim at preserving pulp vitality to ensure further root development and tooth maturation. A 9-year-old boy, who had suffered a concussion injury to the maxillary anterior teeth, was referred after endodontic treatment was initiated in tooth 21 one week earlier. The tooth had incomplete root length, thin dentinal walls and a wide open apex. The pulp chamber had been accessed, and the pulp canal instrumented to size 100. According to the referral, bleeding from the root made it difficult to fill the root canal with calcium hydroxide. No radiographic signs of apical breakdown were recorded. Based on radiographic and clinical findings, a conservative treatment approach was followed to allow continued root development. Follow-up with radiographic examination every 3rd month was performed for 15 months. Continued root formation with apical closure was recorded. In the cervical area, a hard tissue barrier developed, which was sealed with white mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA). Bonded composite was used to seal the access cavity. At the final 2 years follow-up, the tooth showed further root development and was free from symptoms."

        "Abstract": "Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are major excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Two lynx proteins (Nl-lynx1 and Nl-lynx2) have been identified in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, which act as modulators on insect nAChRs. In the present study, two lynx proteins were found to act on the triplet receptor Nlalpha1/Nlalpha2/beta2 expressed in Xenopus oocytes, increasing agonist-evoked macroscopic currents, but not changing agonist sensitivity and desensitization properties. Nl-lynx1 and Nl-lynx2 increased I(max) (maximum responses) of acetylcholine to 4.85-fold and 2.40-fold of that of Nlalpha1/Nlalpha2/beta2 alone, and they also increased I(max) of imidacloprid to 2.57-fold and 1.25-fold. Although, on another triplet nAChRs Nlalpha3/Nlalpha8/beta2, Nl-lynx2 increased I(max) of acetylcholine and imidacloprid to 3.63-fold and 2.16-fold, Nl-lynx1 had no effects on I(max) of either acetylcholine or imidacloprid. The results demonstrate the selectivity of lynx proteins for different insect nAChR subtypes. This selectivity was also identified in native N. Lugens. Co-immunoprecipitation was found between Nlalpha1/Nlalpha2-containing receptors and both Nl-lynx1 and Nl-lynx2, but was only found between Nlalpha3/Nlalpha8-containing receptors and Nl-lynx2. When the previously identified Nlalpha1(Y151S) and Nlalpha3(Y151S) mutations were included (Nlalpha1(Y151S)/Nlalpha2/beta2 and Nlalpha3(Y151S)/Nlalpha8/beta2), the increase in I(max) of imidacloprid, but not acetylcholine, caused by co-expression of Nl-lynx1 and Nl-lynx2 was more noticeable than that of their wildtype counterparts. Taken together, these data suggest that two modulators, Nl-lynx1 and Nl-lynx2, might serve as an influencing factor in target site insensitivity in N. lugens, such as Y151S mutation."

In this study, we use honey bees as a model system because their queens undergo massive and permanent physiological and behavioural changes following mating. Previous studies have identified changes associated with the transition from a virgin queen to a fully mated, egg-laying queen. Here, we further uncouple the mating process to examine the effects of natural mating vs. instrumental insemination and saline vs. semen insemination. We observed effects on flight behaviour, vitellogenin expression and significant overlap in transcriptional profiles between our study and analogous studies in D. melanogaster, suggesting that some post-mating mechanisms are conserved across insect orders."

To study the distribution of this polymorphism in China, 1352 samples were collected from 19 widely distributed Chinese populations. PCR was used to genotype the VNTR. The overall frequencies of allele 1 and allele 2 were 0.913 and 0.064 respectively. The frequency of the allele 2 was significantly different between the northeastern and the northwestern populations. Moreover, the allele frequencies at this locus in three Chinese Han populations were different from that in minority populations. When compared with other populations worldwide, the frequencies of the two alleles in China were not significantly different from those in the Asian and Pacific Islands. However, the prevalence of allele 1 in China was significantly higher, and the prevalence of allele 2 was significantly lower, than those in American and European Caucasians, and the pairwise Fst values reinforced this observation. The differences of the allele frequencies between different regions and within the same region showed that geography and race have important roles in the population differentiation for the IL-1RA gene. In summary, our results provide a valuable reference for population genetic information and future disease association studies in Chinese populations."

        "Abstract": "Although Freud recognized his profound affinity with Spinoza, we seldom find explicit and direct references to the philosopher in his works. The correspondence between Romain Rolland, the 'Christian without a church', and Freud, the 'atheist Jew', is full of Spinozian reminiscences that nourish their works of this period and are underpinned by their mutual transference. The Future of an Illusion is written according to a Spinozian blueprint and aims at replacing religion, qualified as superstition, by psychoanalysis. A quotation from Heine, 'brother in unbelief', is a direct reference to Spinoza. Concurring with Freud's critiques of dogmas and churches, Rolland proposes an analysis of the 'oceanic feeling' as a basis of the religious sentiment. Freud replies with Civilization and Its Discontents. In 1936, on the occasion of Rolland's 70th birthday, Freud sends him an open letter, A disturbance of memory on the Acropolis, where the strange feeling that he has experienced in front of the Parthenon refers inter alia to his double culture: Jewish and German. In the light of this correspondence, the creation of psychoanalysis turns out to be a quest for the sacred that has disappeared in modernity; Freud, though, was able to find it inside man's unconscious."

This paper argues that this is a false dichotomy. An extended vignette of the analysis of a latency-aged girl is used to demonstrate that the psychoanalytic process that develops in child analysis is structurally the same as that in adult analysis. Both revolve around the analysis of resistance and transference and use both to promote knowledge of the patient's mind at work. And both techniques formulate interventions based on the analyst's appraisal of the patient's mental organization. It is hoped that stressing the essential commonality of both techniques will promote the development of an overarching theory of psychoanalytic technique."

        "Abstract": "What is internal and what is external according to psychoanalytic theory? This is a surprisingly complicated question. The terminology is often ambiguous and inconsistent as, for instance, in the use of terms like 'object' and 'other'. The relationship between internal and external in psychoanalysis is analysed from a philosophical, concept analytical, developmental psychological, methodological and trauma versus internal dynamics point of view. It is argued that psychoanalytical writing is influenced by the authors' need to create their personal psychoanalytic theory and language. This is seen as one of the main reasons for the terminological variety and ambiguity in psychoanalytic writing. It is also argued that one particular reason for difficulties concerning the internal-external terminology is the existential anxiety awakened by the threat of the essential aloneness of man. The consciousness of this has a tendency to fade and lead to unclear terminology. The importance of the transitional world as a resting place from the hard reality of this essential aloneness is emphasized. The transitional world is also seen as a necessary part of psychoanalytical practice, as an aid in striving for the truth and reality, important goals of psychoanalysis."

However, freedom is itself an open-ended concept with many aspects that need to be explored and developed from a psychoanalytic perspective. This paper considers one analytic moment from the perspectives of the techniques of Paul Gray, Hans Loewald, the contemporary Kleinians and Jacques Lacan. It argues that, if we are to evaluate these techniques, we must take into account the different conceptions of freedom they are trying to facilitate."

        "Abstract": "Surviving a major historical trauma has consequences that are difficult to live with. Survivors who remain silent are often condemned to a desiccated existence, a dried-out life, a death in life. Survivors who speak out run an even greater risk. Telling their ghastly tale may trigger somatic consequences, psychotic episodes, or even suicide. As to the psychoanalytic cure, the free association it requires carries its own danger: negative therapeutic reaction in sometimes extreme forms. Avoidance of horror may turn into avoidance of life itself. Awful as it may seem, this avoidance of life may represent a victory over a menacing chaos. Should we as analysts accept the risk of endangering such a victory, no matter how unsatisfactory? The psychoanalytical injunction to speak out may trigger an upsurge of shame and terror. Is subjectivation always possible? This paper is about what happens when denial and splitting strategies are suspended, when 'crypts' are opened. Is there an analytic 'poros' allowing for a controlled return of affects? Is there a therapeutic solution to the problem of telling a wreckage without being caught in it? The dangers of 'telling' will be discussed in regard to new analytic strategies and new interpretive registers. When the 'silent psychic sharing' proves insufficient, some analysts go so far as to take part in the shame, share the grief, 'lend their own psyche', become a 'double' of the analysand, accept the existence of 'sanctuaries'. To what effect?"

        "Abstract": "The origins of psychoanalysis, as well as the concerns of our daily endeavors, center on engagement with the fate of the unbearable - be it wish, affect, or experience. In this paper, I explore psychological states and dynamics faced by survivors of genocide and their children in their struggle to sustain life in the midst of unremitting deadliness. Toward this continuous effort, I re-examine Freud's theoretical formulations concerning memory and mourning, elaborate André Green's concept of the 'Dead Mother', and introduce more recent work on the concepts of the 'third' and 'thirdness'. Throughout, my thoughts are informed by our clinical experience with the essential role of witnessing in sustaining life after massive trauma. I bring aspects of all these forms of knowing to reflections about a poem by Primo Levi entitled Unfinished business and to our own never finished business of avoiding denial while living in an age of genocide and under the aura of uncontained destructiveness."

        "Abstract": "This paper will attempt to broaden the conception of witnessing in analytic work with traumatized patients by extending the idea to incorporate the patient's developing and varied capacity for witnessing, as well as a witnessing that occurs within the analytic relationship itself. Actions occuring as part of traumatic repetition are understood to represent memory phenomena and are distinguised from dissociated self-state experience. These experiences are not therapeutically intended to be symbolized, but rather lived-through with the analyst, thus transforming the patient's own relation to the experience. I suggest that the scene in which this living-through takes place is the transference-countertransference matrix, and that it is the analytic encounter that allows traumatic repetition to take on the quality of a communication, an address to another, rather than remain meaningless reproduction. A clinical vignette illustrates the turning of trauma's imperative for witnessing into an address in the analytic encounter."

The years of Nazi persecution and murder brought about a destruction of symbolization and turning inner and external reality into the Thing itself, the concrete, or, in Lacan's words, 'The Thing'. The paper presents two ideas related to praxis as well as theory in treating Holocaust survivors: the first is related to the therapist's treatment of the Holocaust nightmare expressing the traumatic events just as they happened 63 years previously; the second deals with the attempt at subjectification, in contrast to the objectification forced by the Nazis on their victims."

        "Abstract": "Between 1955 and 1960, Melanie Klein wrote some 45 hitherto unpublished letters to Marcelle Spira, the Swiss psychoanalyst living at that time in Geneva. In 2006, after Spira's death, these letters were deposited with the Raymond de Saussure Psychoanalysis Centre in Geneva. They are the only known letters that Klein addressed to her psychoanalyst colleagues. Several topics are mentioned in them: (1) the meetings between the two women in Geneva and London; (2) Spira's contribution to Boulanger's translation into French of The Psychoanalysis of Children, which Klein herself carefully revised; (3) the papers that Klein was at that time working on, including Envy and Gratitude; (4) Spira's own work; (5) the difficulties that Spira, a Kleinian psychoanalyst who trained in Buenos Aires, was encountering in her attempt to be admitted to the Swiss Psychoanalytical Society; and (6) a few items of personal and family news. In addition to the invaluable historical information that these letters provide, they offer us a very moving epistolary self-portrait of Melanie Klein, enabling us to discover her personality in the final years of her life - she died in September 1960, just two months after writing her last letter to Spira."

        "Abstract": "Research on psychoanalytical education within the IPA may be clarified by reflecting on the ethic behind each of the three main models (Eitingonian, French and Uruguayan). In fact, the ethic underpinning psychoanalytical education, whatever the model, is confronted by irreducible conflicts between transmitting psychoanalysis by means of analytical experience or by means of academic teaching. Transmission by experience is essentially based on the ethic of psychoanalytic practice, which is difficult to regulate through institutional standards, whereas the academic aspect can be evaluated by objective and public criteria. The importance of both aspects and their relative weight in the training process depend on the conception of psychoanalysis underlying each model. This paper will look primarily at the French training model, the essentially analytical aspects of which favour the transmission of the very ethical foundations of psychoanalytic practice itself: the application of the method both as a working tool and as a tool of evaluation. It presupposes expanding the observation and analysis of transference beyond the framework of treatment to that of supervision. From this analysis, the paper will attempt to demonstrate how the French model proposes dealing with the inevitable conflicts between transmission by means of analysis and training by means of apprenticeship."

        "Abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy is one of the most common hereditary diseases. Abnormal ion handling renders dystrophic muscle fibers more susceptible to necrosis and a rise in intracellular calcium is an important initiating event in dystrophic muscle pathogenesis. In the mdx mice, muscles are affected with different intensities and some muscles are spared. We investigated the levels of the calcium-binding proteins calsequestrin and calmodulin in the non-spared axial (sternomastoid and diaphragm), limb (tibialis anterior and soleus), cardiac and in the spared extraocular muscles (EOM) of control and mdx mice. Immunoblotting analysis showed a significant increase of the proteins in the spared mdx EOM and a significant decrease in the most affected diaphragm. Both proteins were comparable to the cardiac muscle controls. In limb and sternomastoid muscles, calmodulin and calsequestrin were affected differently. These results suggest that differential levels of the calcium-handling proteins may be involved in the pathogenesis of myonecrosis in mdx muscles. Understanding the signaling mechanisms involving Ca(2+)-calmodulin activation and calsequestrin expression may be a valuable way to develop new therapeutic approaches to the dystrophinopaties."

        "Abstract": "The effects of alcohol on Ca(2+) signalling remains poorly understood. Here we have investigated the effects of acute ethanol exposure on Ca(2+) influx in mouse pancreatic acinar cells. Cells were loaded with fura-2 and the changes in fluorescence were monitored by spectrofluorimetry and imaging analysis. Stimulation of cells with 20 pM cholecystokinin evoked an oscillatory pattern in [Ca(2+)](c), both in the presence and in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+). Stimulation of cells with cholecystokinin in the presence of 50 mM ethanol led to a transformation of physiological oscillations into a single transient increase in [Ca(2+)](c). This effect was observed when Ca(2+) was present in the extracellular medium, and did not appear in its absence. Addition of 1 mM CaCl(2) to the extracellular medium, following release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores by stimulation of cells with 1 nM cholecystokinin or 1 microM thapsigargin in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+), was followed by an increase in [Ca(2+)](c). Ca(2+) influx was increased in the presence of 50 mM ethanol. The anti-oxidant cinnamtannin B-1 (10 microM) or inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase by 4-MP (1 mM), significantly reduced Ca(2+) influx evoked by cholecystokinin in the presence of ethanol. In summary, intoxicating concentrations of ethanol may lead to over stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells by cholecystokinin. This might be partially explained by the generation of reactive oxygen species and an increased Ca(2+) entry in the presence of ethanol. Potentially ethanol might lead to Ca(2+) overload, which is a common pathological precursor that is implicated in pancreatitis."

Few data are available about the relationship between MCs and blood vessels in the normal human thymus, and there are virtually no data about their distribution and significance in thymoma. The aim of this study was to analyse the spatial distribution of MCs and microvessels in the normal foetal and adult thymus and thymoma. Twenty biopsy specimens of human thymus, including foetal and adult normal thymus and thymoma were analysed. Double staining with CD34 and mast cell tryptase was used to count both mast cells and microvessels in the same fields. Computer-assisted image analysis was performed to characterize the spatial distribution of MCs and blood vessels in selected specimens. Results demonstrated that MCs were localized exclusively to the medulla. Their number was significantly higher in thymoma specimens as compared with adult and foetal normal specimens respectively. In contrast the microvessel area was unchanged. The analysis of the spatial distribution and relationship between MCs and microvessels revealed that only in the thymoma specimens was there a significant spatial association between MCs and microvessels. Overall, these data suggest that MCs do not contribute significantly to the development of the vascular network in foetal and adult thymus, whereas in thymoma they show a close relationship to blood vessels. This could be an expression of their involvement not only in endothelial cells but also in tumour cell proliferation."

        "Abstract": "Skeletal muscle abnormalities can contribute to decreased exercise capacity in heart failure. Although muscle atrophy is a common alteration in heart failure, the mechanisms responsible for muscle mass reduction are not clear. Myostatin, a member of TGF-beta family (transforming growth factor), regulates muscle growth and mass. Several studies have shown a negative correlation between myostatin expression and muscle mass. The aim of this study was to evaluate myostatin expression in skeletal muscles of rats with heart failure. As myostatin gene expression can be modulated by follistatin, we also evaluated its expression. Heart failure was induced by myocardial infarction (MI, n = 10); results were compared to Sham-operated group (n = 10). Ventricular function was assessed by echocardiogram. Gene expression was analyzed by real-time PCR and protein levels by Western blotting in the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles; fibre trophism was evaluated by morphometric analysis. MI group presented heart failure evidence such as pleural effusion and right ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular dilation and dysfunction were observed in MI group. In the soleus muscle, cross-sectional area (P = 0.006) and follistatin protein levels (Sham 1.00 +/- 0.36; MI 0.18 +/- 0.06 arbitrary units; P = 0.03) were lower in MI and there was a trend for follistatin gene expression to be lower in MI group (P = 0.085). There was no change in myostatin expression between groups. In gastrocnemius, all MI group parameters were statistically similar to the Sham. In conclusion, our data show that during chronic heart failure, decreased skeletal muscle trophism is combined with unchanged myostatin and reduced follistatin expression."

Alternate indications for its use are less well characterised, and performance in other clinical settings may differ.Methods:We examined a prospectively collected cohort comprising the first 215 patients undergoing EBUS-TBNA at our institution. Patients were analysed according to the clinical and radiological indication for referral. We also examined the effect of the procedural learning curve on diagnostic sensitivity.Results:A total of 215 patients underwent 216 EBUS-TBNA procedures. EBUS-TBNA returned adequate tissue for cytopathological analysis in 202 of 216 procedures (94%). Overall sensitivity for detection of malignancy was 0.92 (95% confidence interval 0.86-0.96); however, this varied according to the primary indication for EBUS-TBNA. Diagnostic sensitivity was high among all sub-groups, but the negative predictive value varied depending on the clinical indication for the procedure. We estimate 104 invasive surgical procedures and 32 inpatient admissions were avoided by use of EBUS-TBNA. Significant improvement in diagnostic performance was seen after 20 procedures were completed, and diagnostic accuracy did not peak until after 50 procedures.Conclusions:EBUS-TBNA is able to confirm accurately histologically a large number of disease processes, both malignant and benign, in all clinical indications studied. The procedure is safe even when carried out by proceduralists with minimal prior experience. Diagnostic performance continues to improve beyond 50 cases carried out."

        "Abstract": "Lung cancer accounts for more cancer-related deaths than any other malignancy in Australia and worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 85% of lung cancers and is associated with a 5-year survival of only 15%. Treatment with platinum-based doublets in the first-line setting and single agent chemotherapy in the second-line setting has improved survival and quality of life in patients with NSCLC. However, the benefits associated with chemotherapy are modest and serve to stress the need for novel therapeutic approaches. In the last decade a range of targeted therapies has been evaluated in NSCLC. Dramatic and often durable responses were seen in patients treated with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) gefitinib and erlotinib particularly in females, non-smokers, patients of East Asian ethnicity and those with adenocarcinomas - a group subsequently found to be enriched for tumours with activating EGFR mutations. Large randomized phase III trials have since established a role for EGFR TKI in the second- and third-line setting as well as a potential role for the monoclonal antibodies bevacizumab and cetuximab, directed at vascular endothelial growth factor and EGFR, respectively, in the combination with chemotherapy in the first-line setting. Recently it has been shown that patients with EGFR mutations may benefit from gefitinib in the first-line setting. Other promising agents under evaluation are inhibitors of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and inhibitors of recently described ALK gene rearrangements."

        "Abstract": "Background:Ageism among health professionals is increasingly recognized, but few studies investigated hospital doctors' attitudes towards older people. The aims of this study were to investigate hospital doctors' attitudes towards older people and to determine whether factors, which were identified in studies on other health professionals, influence hospital doctors' attitudes.Methods:Hospital doctors who worked in General Medicine or Aged Care units in two tertiary public hospitals in metropolitan Victoria, Australia, in 2008 were surveyed with Fraboni's Scale of Ageism (FSA), a validated instrument used to investigate attitudes towards older people. Demographic data from participants were collected.Results:Of the 235 questionnaires distributed, 122 were returned (overall response rate 51.9%). Response rate was highest among consultants (80.4%), followed by registrars (64.1%) and lowest among interns and residents (35.2%). The mean FSA score attained by the respondents was 61.5 (SD 11.0), representing a point between a neutral and a positive disposition. Doctors' characteristics that were associated with more positive attitudes towards older people included age of 30years or older (P < 0.001), female gender (P= 0.003), more senior in position (P < 0.001), postgraduate years of 10 or more (P < 0.001), previous working experience in Aged Care (P < 0.001), interest in Aged Care (P < 0.001) and more frequent social contacts with healthy older people (P < 0.001).Conclusion:Hospital doctors of different demographic features and background characteristics display different attitudes towards older people. These findings can be used to inform future development of undergraduate and postgraduate medical curricula and form a basis for future studies on the effectiveness of these interventions in improving doctors' attitudes."

        "Abstract": "Background/aims:The Bosentan Patient Registry (BPR) was a prospective, multicentre, Australian registry funded by Actelion Pharmaceuticals. The primary aim of the registry was to collect survival data in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) treated with bosentan.Methods:The BPR was initiated in 15 specialized PAH centres. All patients on or starting bosentan were invited to enrol. Treating physicians notified the registry if patients discontinued bosentan, because of either a change in therapy, transplantation, intervention or death. Survival data were validated against the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare National Death Index.Results:Between 2004 and 2007, a total of 528 patients (mean age 59 ± 17 years) were enrolled representing 69% of patients either previously taking or initiated on bosentan during that time. The BPR population was generally older with more advanced functional deficit than patients enrolled in randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Aetiology was idiopathic (iPAH) in 58% and connective tissue disease related (scleroderma (SSc)-PAH) in 42%. For iPAH patients, World Health Organisation functional classes II, III and IV at enrolment was 8.2%, 66.4% and 20.5%, and for the SSc-PAH cohort, 3.2%, 75.8% and 17.9% respectively. The observed annual mortality was 11.8% in patients with iPAH and 16.6% in patients SSc-PAH.Conclusion:This large Australian registry provides 'real life' information on the characteristics and management of PAH in clinical practice. Treatment with bosentan improved survival outcomes in both iPAH and SSc-PAH compared with historical controls. Age, disease severity and aetiology were critical factors in determining clinical outcomes."

Preoperative carotid ultrasonography can identify significant stenosis, but there is debate about the value of screening. The aims of this study were to (i) determine the prevalence of significant carotid artery disease in screened patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery and (ii) correlate their ultrasonographic findings with perioperative strokes.Methods:Retrospective analysis of 166 patients (118 men, 48 women) who underwent a preoperative carotid ultrasound and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) from 2004 to 2007. Perioperative strokes were recorded and compared with ultrasonographic and clinical data. A separate cohort of 1423 patients (1064 men, 359 women) who underwent CABG over the same period was also evaluated.Results:Only 11 screened patients (6.6%) had significant (>70%) carotid artery disease and two of these underwent simultaneous carotid endarterectomy. There were five perioperative strokes in screened patients, four of which occurred in individuals with <50% disease. Compared with the non-screened cohort, ultrasound screened patients were older and more likely to have a prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, peripheral vascular disease and/or renal impairment than non-screened patients. There was no significant difference in perioperative strokes compared with non-screened patients (3% vs 1.2% respectively, P= NS).Conclusion:There is a low prevalence of significant carotid artery disease in ultrasound screened patients. The risk of perioperative strokes in screened patients is low and not significantly different from non-screened patients."

The aim of this study of patients with NF was to determine the clinical characteristics at presentation, causative pathogens and subsequent clinical outcome.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients with NF presenting to Middlemore Hospital from January 2000 to June 2006.Results:Eighty-two patients were evaluated: 56% male, mean age 54.9 years (standard deviation 18.5), 40% Pacific Islanders. The site of infection was the lower limb in 46 (56%) patients, upper limb in 12 (15%) patients and perineum in 13 (16%) patients. Twenty-two (27%) patients were taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 29 (35%) had diabetes mellitus, 25 (30%) had gout and 17 (21%) had congestive heart failure. Forty-nine (60%) patients had a surgical procedure within 24 h of admission. Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated from tissue or blood cultures in 33 (40%) patients and 26 (32%) patients had polymicrobial infection. Twenty-five (30%) patients died, 17 (68%) within 72 h of admission. Independent predictors of mortality include congestive heart failure (P = 0.033) and a history of gout (P = 0.037).Conclusion:NF remains an important disease in our community with significant morbidity and mortality. Pacific Islanders were disproportionately represented. Early diagnosis of NF can be difficult and requires a high index of suspicion in all patients presenting with cellulitis or unexplained sepsis. Congestive heart failure and gout are independent predictors of mortality and patients with these conditions and sepsis need early assessment with more aggressive hospital triaging."

The climate and geographical diversity of tropical Australia, together with the prevalence of melioidosis, disseminated gonococcal disease and community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus renders this a challenging environment in which to manage such infections. We evaluated patients managed by the Royal Darwin Hospital Hospital in the Home service for bone and joint infections.Methods:A retrospective analysis of the therapeutic outcomes at the end of intravenous therapy was carried out for patients treated between 1 January 2006 and 15 September 2007.Results:Fifty-five patients were treated, including 21 (38%) indigenous Australians and 18 (33%) from remote communities. Baseline characteristics were similar to other published data, but there were two cases each of gonococcal septic arthritis and melioidosis. During treatment, 39 (71%) lived at home, with five (9%) of these receiving treatment at community clinics. Thirteen (24%) resided in self-care units in the hospital grounds. Three (5%) were managed at hostels or in prison. Median duration of parenteral therapy was 42 days, with a median of 22 days outside hospital, providing a total saving of 1307 bed-days. Clinical success at end of therapy was 84%, with no significant difference between indigenous and non-indigenous cohorts.Conclusion:OPAT for osteoarticular infections is both feasible and effective in a tropical environment, including for indigenous patients. Extension of treatment to remote-dwelling patients is facilitated by the innovative use of self-care units and administration of treatment at remote clinics."

When analysis was restricted to Binet stage A patients, CD38 expression identified a subset of patients (21%) who, in common with Binet stage B/C patients, had a significantly shorter OS and TFS (P<0.0015), and a TFS at 4 years of <10%. In contrast, CD38-negative Binet stage A patients had an OS that was not significantly different from that of an age/sex-matched NZ population and a 5-year TFS of 77%.Conclusion:This study indicates that, when combined with clinical staging, the presence of any detectable CD38 expression can be used to further improve the identification of CLL patients with more aggressive disease (i.e. Binet stage B/C or Binet stage A and CD38 positive). This will allow better identification of those patients requiring more intensive monitoring and also allow improved patient counselling regarding prognosis."

This study evaluated the compliance with a clinical pathway that combines risk assessment (Wells score) with d-dimer, ventilation-perfusion scanning or computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA). The aims of this study were to identify factors that contribute to compliance and to assess patient outcomes and resource utilization.Methods:Repeated retrospective chart reviews of 239 patients who underwent investigation for pulmonary embolism through our emergency department extracted patient demographics, pathway parameters and patient outcomes. A phone interview at 3-month follow up was carried out.Results:Incidence of pulmonary embolism was 8.4% (n= 20). Compliance to the clinical pathway occurred in 120 subjects (50.2%). Non-compliance occurred in 71 subjects (29.7%). Forty-eight subjects (20.1%) underwent risk assessments, but subsequent diagnostic tests did not conform to the stated pathway (partial compliance). Compliance was poor in subjects assessed by non-emergency department doctors (χ(2) = 27.95, P≤ 0.001). Compliance occurred less in pregnant subjects (χ(2) = 7.27, P= 0.007) and those with chronic respiratory disease (χ(2) = 5.31, P= 0.021). Subjects in the compliant group were less likely to undergo CTPA (odds ratio 2.07 (1.16-3.70), P= 0.012).Conclusions:Compliance with this clinical pathway allowed emergency department doctors in an Australian university teaching hospital to complete diagnostic testing for suspected pulmonary embolism appropriately unless non-emergency department doctors became involved. Compliance with this pathway altered the distribution of diagnostic tests performed with less reliance on CTPA, but was not associated with better patient outcomes."

The aims of this study were to document opioids and dosages given to patients in the last 24 h of life to identify normal practice and allow prescribers to reflect on their own practice.Methods:A cross-sectional benchmarking design with retrospective chart review was carried out among 14 NZ hospices. Data (n = 352) on opioid dosages were analysed for inter-hospice variability (ANOVA). Parenteral morphine equivalent daily dose was used to analyse the dosage of different opioids.Results:Overall, 95% of dying patients received an opioid. Of these 71% received morphine, 17% fentanyl, 10% methadone 9.5% oxycodone. The dosages delivered are conservative compared with international data, with a geometric mean of 47.8 mg. There was no significant difference in mean dosages of opioids prescribed between hospice teams. There was, however, a significant difference between the dosage of opioid for those on the Liverpool Care Pathway for the Care of the Dying and those who were not (63.1-44.4 mg), and between those with malignant and non-malignant disease (53.8-26.0 mg). Opioid footprints show different hospices have different patterns of opioid use.Conclusion:The parameters of what normal opioid prescribing is in the last days of life in NZ can be described from these data. There is value in repeating this exercise both for clinical governance and for professional reflection and self-assessment."

        "Abstract": "1. The size individuals attain reflects complex interactions between food availability and quality, environmental conditions and ecological interactions. A statistical interaction between temperature and the density of conspecifics is expected to arise from various ecological dynamics, including bioenergetic constraints, if population density affects mean consumption rate or activity level. Density effects on behaviour or size-selective predation could also generate this pattern. This interaction plays an important role in bioenergetic models, in particular, and yet has not been documented in natural populations. 2. The lengths of 131 286 juvenile wild Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) across 13 populations spread throughout the Salmon River Basin, Idaho, USA over 15 years were compared to test whether juvenile density alters the relationship between body size and temperature. 3. Strong evidence for a negative interaction between mean summer temperature and density emerged, despite the relatively cool temperatures in this high elevation habitat. Growth correlated positively with temperature at lower densities, but the correlation was negative at the highest densities. 4. This is the first study to document this interaction at such a large spatial and temporal scale, and suggests that warmer temperatures might intensify some density-dependent processes. How climate change will affect individual growth rates in these populations will depend intimately on ecological conditions, particularly food availability and population dynamics. More broadly, the conditions that led to the interactions observed in our study - limited food availability and temperatures that ranged above those optimal for growth - likely exist for many other natural populations, and warrant broader exploration."

Body size differences among coexisting related species are common, but the actual effect of these differences in mitigating interspecific interactions, such as resource competition and reproductive interference, is poorly understood. 2. Local assemblages of the ground beetle genus Carabus (subgenus Ohomopterus) typically consist of two or more species of varying sizes. Through foraging and mating experiments using four Ohomopterus species in parapatry and sympatry, we examined whether interspecific body size differences are effective in partitioning food resources or reducing reproductive interference. 3. Because larval Ohomopterus feed exclusively on earthworms, body size differences may be related to partitioning earthworms of different sizes. However, larvae did not exhibit differences in selectivity or attack success on earthworms of different sizes based on larval body size, indicating little possibility of partitioning food by body size. 4. In contrast, interspecific mating behaviours, such as mate recognition, mounting, and copulation, were hindered when body size differences were large; copulation was frequently accomplished between parapatric species with smaller body size differences. 5. These results suggest that body size differences between species effectively reduce reproductive interference, rather than resource competition. Although body size differences in coexisting closely related species have been considered to function in resource partitioning, they may function primarily in reproductive isolation and thereby facilitate coexistence of species."

Environmental change has also led to warmer winters, shortening the distance between the breeding grounds of migratory birds and their overwintering areas. 2. Here, we show that in response to warmer winters, blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), but not great tits (Parus major), breeding in Germany decreased their migration distance between 1964 and 1996. Understanding this difference provides insight into possible constraints and selection pressures involved in how species respond to environmental change. Here, we focus on their breeding ecology. 3. In a nest box population in southern Germany, both species laid their first clutch earlier with increasing spring temperature, but over the study period (1974-1999) blue tits showed a significant and stronger advancement in laying date than great tits. For both species, selection for earlier breeding did not vary with environmental change, indicating that early laying pairs did not do better than later laying pairs as spring temperature increased. 4. Blue tits in the nest box population were single-brooded and existing hypotheses state that single-brooded species likely advance their laying date to match timing of reproduction with the advancing food peak in spring. We hypothesize that this might be one reason why blue tits adjusted their migration strategy as closer proximity to the breeding grounds in winter allows better prediction of the onset of spring. Ten per cent of great tits successfully produced second broods and their first clutch laying date is a compromise between first and second clutch laying date, which might be why great tits had not advanced their laying date nor altered their migration strategy."

We explain that anova calculates the sum of squares for each term in the model formula sequentially (type I sums of squares) and show how anova tables of adjusted sums of squares are composite tables assembled from multiple sequential analyses. A different anova is performed for each explanatory variable or interaction so that each term is placed last in the model formula in turn and adjusted for the others. 3. The sum of squares for each term in the analysis can be calculated after adjusting only for the main effects of other explanatory variables (type II sums of squares) or, controversially, for both main effects and interactions (type III sums of squares). 4.

        "Abstract": "1. Climate is an important factor influencing the population dynamics of large herbivores operating directly on individuals or through its effect on forage characteristics. However, the seasonal effect of climate may differ between forage- and predator-limited populations because of a climatic influence on predation rates. The influence of climate on predator-limited large herbivores is less well known than on forage-limited populations. Further, the effect of Pacific-based climate on large herbivore populations has been rarely assessed. 2. We investigated the effect of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), across different seasons, on recruitment in 10 populations (herds) of mountain-dwelling caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou L. in the Yukon Territory, Canada. These low-density populations occur in highly seasonal environments and are considered predator-limited with high neonatal calf mortality. Hence, in most years females do not spend resources through lactational support during the summer and resource intake is devoted to self-maintenance. We predicted that climate affecting environmental conditions at calving would have a strong effect on recruitment via its influence on predation rates. We also predicted that climatic conditions prior to conception could have an effect on recruitment through its influence on female fecundity. We modelled recruitment (n = 165) by seasonal PDO values using generalized linear mixed-effects models with herd-varying coefficients. 3. We found that recruitment variability was best explained by variation in winter climate (beta = 0.110, SE = 0.007) prior to birth (in utero) and May climate (beta = 0.013, SE = 0.006) at calving. There was little support for a pre-conception climate effect influencing female body condition and hence fecundity. These results confirm that recruitment in these populations is limited by predation and that forage-limitation is not a significant factor in their population dynamics. There was considerable variability in herd-specific relationships between the PDO and recruitment. Incorporating herd-specific characteristics, such as variable predator densities or terrain characteristics within a herd range, may shed greater light on the complex relationship between climate and ungulate population dynamics."

        "Abstract": "Aims:Tempe, a Rhizopus ssp.-fermented soya bean food product, was investigated for bacteriostatic and/or bactericidal effects against cells and spores of the food-borne pathogen Bacillus cereus.Methods and results:Tempe extract showed a high antibacterial activity against B. cereus ATCC 14579 based on optical density and viable count measurements. This growth inhibition was manifested by a 4 log CFU ml(-1) reduction, within the first 15 min of exposure. Tempe extracts also rapidly inactivated B. cereus spores upon germination. Viability and membrane permeability assessments using fluorescence probes showed rapid inactivation and permeabilization of the cytoplasmic membrane confirming the bactericidal mode of action. Cooked beans and Rhizopus grown on different media did not show antibacterial activity, indicating the unique association of the antibacterial activity with tempe. Subsequent characterization of the antibacterial activity revealed that heat treatment and protease addition nullified the bactericidal effect, indicating the proteinaceous nature of the bioactive compound.Conclusions:During fermentation of soya beans with Rhizopus, compounds are released with extensive antibacterial activity against B. cereus cells and spores.Significance and impact of study:The results show the potential of producing natural antibacterial compounds that could be used as ingredients in food preservation and pathogen control."

The morphological characteristics of the biofilm were assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Biochemical characterization of the exopolysaccharide was carried out by gel permeation chromatography, gas chromatography (GC), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Microscopic studies of C. albicans biofilm revealed complex, heterogeneous three-dimensional structure, in which yeast cells and hyphal elements were entrenched within exopolysaccharides matrix. Chromatographic analysis data indicated C. albicans exopolysaccharide (c. 300 kDa) to be made up of four major sugar units. The FTIR spectrum revealed specific absorbance of O-H, C-H, O=C=O, C=O, C-N and C-C ring stretching. (1) H and (13) C NMR data showed the presence of β (1→6) and β (1→3) linkages in the exopolysaccharide chain that were assigned to α-D-glucose and β-D-glucose, α-D-mannose, α-L-rhamnose and N-acetyl glucosamine (β-D-GlcNAc), respectively.Conclusions:Study suggested the production of a water soluble c. 300 kDa exopolysaccharide by C. albicans made up of glucose, mannose, rhamnose and N-acetyl glucosamine subunits.Significance and impact of the study:The study could assist in the development of novel therapeutics aimed at disrupting C. albicans biofilms that will translate into improved clearance of Candida-related infections."

Further, an acid-tolerant yeast mutant was isolated by adaptive selection that was prone to grow at low pH in inorganic but weak organic acid. It showed higher viability under acid-temperature synergistic treatment. However, it was deficient in some physiological aspects that are associated with defects in protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. Microarray analysis showed the induction of genes involved in inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis.Conclusions:The results point out that low pH activates GSR, mainly heat shock response, that is important for long-term cell survival and suggest that a fine regulatory PKA-dependent mechanism that might affect cell cycle in order to acquire tolerance to acid environment.Significance and impact of the study:These findings might guide the construction of a high-fermentative stress-tolerant industrial yeast strain that can be used in complex industrial fermentation processes."

Although various studies about these enzymes were accomplished in the past, some contradicting information about the enzyme pattern in this bacterium still exists. To resolve these discrepancies, the C(3) /C(4) metabolism was reinvestigated after the genome sequence of this bacterium became available.Methods and results:In silico analysis of genome sequence revealed putative genes coding for NAD(P)(+) -dependent malic enzymes (Mae), phoshoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (Ppc), phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (Pps) and pyruvate carboxylase (Pyc). Reverse transcription PCR revealed constitutive expression of mae and pck genes, whereas no transcripts of pyc and ppc were found. Expression of active NADP(+) -dependent MaeB and Pck and absence of Pyc and Ppc was confirmed by spectrophotometric enzyme assays.Conclusions:The data reported in this study suggest that two enzymes, (i) MaeB and (ii) Pck, mediate between the C(3) and C(4) intermediates in R. eutropha H16. The enzymatic conversion of pyruvate into phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is catalysed by Pps, and an NADH(+) -dependent Mdh mediates the reversible conversion of malate and oxaloacetate.Significance and impact of the study:An increased knowledge of the enzymes mediating between C(3) and C(4) intermediates in R. eutropha will facilitate metabolic engineering."

We hypothesize that Salmonella biofilms are more resilient to disinfectants compared to planktonic Salmonella.Methods and results:The susceptibility of planktonic cells to disinfectants was tested by a modified version of the Council of Europe suspension test EN 1276. Salmonella biofilms were formed using the Calgary Biofilm Device. Results show that 3-day-old Salmonella biofilms are less susceptible to the disinfectants benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine gluconate, citric acid, quaternary ammonium compounds, sodium hypochlorite (SH) and ethanol, compared to planktonic Salmonella. Surprisingly, the results also demonstrate that low concentrations of SH were more effective against a 3-day-old biofilm compared to high concentrations of SH.Conclusions:While all the disinfectants evaluated were able to reduce biofilm-associated cells at concentrations and contact times sufficient to eliminate planktonic cells, there were still sufficient viable cells remaining in the biofilm to cause further contamination and potential infection.Significance and impact of the study:Protocols for the use of chemical disinfectants need to include biofilm susceptibility testing. There is a requirement for an effective and standardized tool for determining the susceptibility of biofilms to disinfectants."

Cardiovascular disease now is an important cause of death in HIV-infected patients.Patients and methods:In the multicenter, prospective HIV-HEART study, 222 (38 %) patients suffered from lipodystrophy. Women were more often affected than men (41.5 % vs. 25.3 %). Patients with lipodystrophy were on average 5 years older and had been infected longer (10.4 vs. 6.6 years) then patients without lipodystrophy.Results:Lipodystrophy in HIV patients was a clinical sign of cardiovascular risk factors like hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol 19 mg/dl higher, HDL 2.8 mg/dl lower, triglycerides 53 mg/dl higher) and type 2 diabetes (11.3 % vs. 2.8 %). Patients with lipodystrophy were more likely to be co-infected with hepatitis B (34.7 % vs. 28.8 %, p = 0.122) or C (13.1 % vs. 9.3 %, p = 0.16) than patients without lipodystrophy. The quality of life was reduced in patients with lipodystrophy. In 6 of 8 scales of the SF-36 questionnaire, patients with lipodystrophy had lower scores.Conclusions:Lipodystrophy syndrome is an early warning system for a number of illnesses which reduce life expectancy. Dermatologists must help insure that HIV-infected patients receive treatment for these disorders."

        "Abstract": "Cold seeps are areas of the seafloor where hydrogen sulfide- and methane-rich fluid seepage occurs, often sustaining chemosynthetic ecosystems. It is well known that both archaea and bacteria oxidize sulfides and methane to produce chemical energy and that several endemic animals use this energy to thrive in cold seeps. On the other hand, there is little knowledge regarding diversity and ecology of microbial eukaryotes in this ecosystem. In this study we isolated environmental RNA and DNA from microbial mats of cold-seep sediment in Sagami Bay, Japan, and retrieved eukaryotic small-subunit ribosomal RNA sequences with polymerase chain reaction methods followed by clone library construction. Most RNA-derived clones obtained were from ciliates, although DNA-derived clones were mainly from the fungus Cryptococcus curvatus, suggesting that ciliates are active in the environment. The ciliate sequences were phylogenetically diverse, and represented eight known class lineages as well as undesignated lineages. Because most ciliates are bacterivorous, it is highly likely that the ciliates for which sequences were recovered play a role in the food web of this ecosystem as grazers of microbial mats. In addition, given that the environment studied is under highly reduced (anoxic) conditions, based on the prokaryotic community structure deduced from T-RFLP profiles, the ciliates detected may be obligatory or facultative anaerobes."

Infections, affecting plants in South and Central America, can result in significant economic loss. The study of trypanosomatids that cause these diseases has been complicated due to the inability to culture these organisms for in vitro analyses. To develop a protocol that would facilitate studies of trypanosomatids, continuous in vitro cultures of phloemic trypanosomatids were established from apical stems of diseased coconut trees collected in endemic and non-endemic regions of Brazil (the states of Bahia and Rio de Janeiro, respectively). Although attempts at establishing axenic cultures were unsuccessful, it was found that trypanosomatid co-cultures could be successfully established and maintained. The procedure was to preculture media with 10(4)Aedes albopictus cells in Grace's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (without antibiotics or fungicides) for 3 d before adding 10(6) trypanosomatids/ml harvested from either fresh apical stem extracts or with 2 mm(3) fragments of coconut apical stems. By day 7 under these conditions the parasites grew exponentially. Using this strategy, two isolates were identified and have been maintained in our laboratory for over 400 passages, demonstrating the efficacy of this culturing procedure. In situ the organisms were observed in vascular bundles and inside sieve elements of the phloem of diseased palms. In vitro parasites retained their mobility. Morphometric analysis revealed differences between Bahia and Rio de Janeiro isolates."

Primary malignant oral tumors that show a neuroendocrine phenotype display histomorphologic heterogeneity thereby giving rise to a spectrum of lesions in this rare category of oral malignancy. These lesions can be divided into neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) of small cell or non-small cell type. The former is further subdivided into the Merkel cell type or the pulmonary type while the latter includes atypical carcinoid tumor and large cell NEC. All histologic subtypes of oral NEC appear to have a strong predilection for men in their fifth or sixth decade and arise predominantly in the non-keratinized oral mucosa. The biologic behavior of oral Merkel cell carcinomas appears to be more aggressive than those of skin. It remains to be determined whether histologic categorization of the remaining tumor subtypes is predictive of patient survival in oral neuroendocrine tumors."

In the present study we first attempted to investigate the SH3BP2 gene in peripheral giant cell lesion (PGCL). The effect of SH3BP2 gene mutations on the transcription of the downstream genes nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATc1) and the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was also investigated together with the immunolocalization of NFATc1 protein in a set of cases of PGCL, CGCL and cherubism with and without SH3BP2 mutation.Method:Fresh samples of five PGCL, five CGCL and one cherubism cases were included in this study. One of the samples of CGCL presented a somatic heterozygous mutation c.1442A>T in exon 11. The cherubism case showed a heterozygotic substitution c.320C>T in both blood and lesion. These mutations were previously published. All coding and flanking regions of the SH3BP2 gene were sequenced in the cases of PGCL. The real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to analyze the transcription of NFATc1 and TNF-alpha genes. The immunohistochemical analysis of the NFATc1 protein was also performed.Results:No SH3BP2 gene mutation was found in PGCL. The RT-PCR showed increased expression of NFATc1 and decreased transcription of TNF-alpha in all the samples. The immunohistochemical analysis of the NFATc1 protein showed a predominant nuclear staining in the multinucleated giant cells.Conclusion:The development of giant cells lesions of the jaws and cherubism are possibly mediated by overexpression of NFAT in the nucleus of the multinucleated cells."

To better examine this potential opportunity, data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2004 were used to determine if a larger proportion of patients with periodontal disease as compared with those without periodontitis would be recommended for screening according to American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines. The data were also used to determine whether at-risk individuals with periodontitis visited a dental professional recently, so that they could avail themselves of this opportunity for screening, if offered.Methods:Data to perform these analyses were collected from 2,923 subjects aged 20 and older who reported that they were never told that they had diabetes, had a periodontal examination, and had sufficient data to compute body mass index. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, and chi-square analyses that compared those with and without periodontitis were extrapolated to the US population.Results:A total of 62.9 percent of those without periodontitis and 93.4 percent of those with periodontal disease met ADA guidelines for diabetes screening. Of those at-risk with periodontal disease, 33.9 percent had seen a dentist in the past 6 months, 50 percent in the past year, and 60.4 percent in the past 2 years.Conclusions:As almost all individuals with periodontitis would have been recommended for diabetes screening, and many at-risk persons with periodontal disease recently visited a dentist, our data suggest that the dental visit provides an important potential venue for this screening."

We also estimate a multivariate model controlling for potentially confounding variables.Results:Overall, mean OOP dental expenditures among those with any spending were substantially larger for those without coverage than for those with coverage. However, controlling for coverage shows that there is little difference in spending by retirement status.Conclusions:Although having dental coverage is a key determinant of the level of OOP expenditures on dental care; spending is higher among those without coverage than those who have dental insurance. We also found that while retirement has no independent effect on OOP dental expenditures once controlling for coverage, dental coverage rates are much lower among retirees."

The aim of this study was to identify factors contributing to the recruitment and retention of dentists in the public sector.Methods:A postal questionnaire survey of 180 dentists (response rate 75.6 percent) working in the Victorian public sector was undertaken to investigate the characteristics of public sector dentists, job satisfaction, remuneration, perceptions of public dentistry, future career intentions, and issues that relate to recruitment and retention of staff.Results:Victorian public dentists' main reason for entering the public sector was to work in a community-based setting in a supportive and mentored environment. The main factors related to dentists leaving the public sector were poor remuneration, lack of clinical experience, and frustration with administrative policies. Victoria's oral health workforce shortages in the public sector are mainly attributed to retention issues. The potential for mentoring and a desire for helping those in need were factors attracting dentists to work in the public sector.Conclusion:There was a disproportionate number of female dentists in the public sector compared with the general population, and female dentists had a lower mean salary than male dentists regardless of experience. A range of factors were associated with retention, and gradual frustration because of poor remuneration and lack of professional autonomy were significant reasons for the decision to leave the public sector."

        "Abstract": "Objective:The aim of this study was to determine the association between obesity and caries by utilizing the data of a cohort of preschool children aged 4-5 years.Methods:Data were obtained from a cohort of 1,160 children. Dental caries detection was performed according to the World Health Organization criteria. The caries index was measured as the number of decayed (d), extracted (e), and filled (f) teeth (t) (deft), or surfaces (defs). The body mass index (BMI) in units of kg/m2 was determined, and children were categorized according to age- and gender-specific criteria as normal weight (5th-85th percentile), at-risk overweight (> or = 85th-<95th percentile), and overweight (> or = 95th percentile). Odds ratios were determined for at-risk overweight and overweight children using logistic regression.Results:The prevalence of dental caries was 17.9 percent. A slightly higher percentage of dental caries was found in boys (19.6 percent) than in girls (16.4 percent). From the total sample, the mean BMI was 17.10 +/- 3.83. Approximately 53.7 percent of children were classified as normal weight, 14.2 percent as at-risk overweight, and 32.1 percent as overweight. At-risk overweight children were higher among girls (17.1 percent) than among boys (11.3 percent). When adjusted for covariates, the logistic regression model showed that there was a significant association between at-risk overweight children (P < 0.001), overweight children (P < 0.001), and caries in the primary dentition. Mean (SD) deft value of the sample was 1.08 (2.34), while the corresponding defs value was 1.43 (3.29).Conclusion:Obesity appears to be associated with dental caries in the primary dentition of preschool Mexican children."

        "Abstract": "In this work we unmask a novel downregulation mechanism of the uric acid/xanthine transporter UapA, the prototype member of the ubiquitous Nucleobase-Ascorbate Transporter family, directly related to its function. In the presence of substrates, UapA is endocytosed, sorted into the multivesicular body pathway and degraded in vacuoles. Substrate-induced endocytosis, unlike ammonium-induced turnover, is absolutely dependent on UapA activity and several lines of evidence showed that the signal for increased endocytosis is the actual translocation of substrates through the UapA protein. The use of several UapA functional mutants with altered kinetics and specificity has further shown that transport-dependent UapA endocytosis occurs through a mechanism, which senses subtle conformational changes associated with the transport cycle. We also show that distinct mechanisms of UapA endocytosis necessitate ubiquitination of a single Lys residue (K572) by HulA(Rsp5). Finally, we demonstrate that in the presence of substrates, non-functional UapA versions can be endocytosed in trans if expressed in the simultaneous presence of active UapA versions, even if the latter cannot be endocytosed themselves."

We investigated the prevalence of T. tonsurans infection in athletes affiliated to judo clubs in the 21 First Division universities that were registered with the University Judo Federation of Tokyo in 2008. Study procedures performed by the subjects included (i) completion of a questionnaire concerning lifestyle, risk factors for tinea corporis and medical history; (ii) scrubbing the scalp with a circular hairbrush to obtain samples for fungal culture; (iii) anti-fungal treatment as recommended by a dermatologist, based on the number of fungal colonies isolated from the hairbrush; and (iv) repeat testing using the hairbrush method 3 months after treatment recommendations were received. Of 902 study subjects, 102 (11.3%) yielded positive hairbrush culture results. Of these, 14 individuals (13.7%) had tinea corporis; the remainder were asymptomatic. Conversion to negative fungal culture was observed in 85 of 96 culture-positive individuals who performed the second hairbrush culture test following treatment. Control of T. tonsurans infection among judo athletes could be achieved by educating athletes, trainers and coaches in judo clubs concerning detection, prevention, and treatment of T. tonsurans infection."

The prevalence of C. dubliniensis in association with other disease conditions has been infrequently reported. In this study, we present data on the prevalence of C. dubliniensis among yeast species isolated from cancer patients over a 5-year period. A total of 1445 yeast isolates recovered from respiratory specimens, blood, urine and oral swabs were analysed. Candida dubliniensis isolates were provisionally identified by phenotypic methods and their identity was further confirmed by species-specific amplification and/or sequencing of internally transcribed spacer region of rDNA. Antifungal susceptibility for fluconazole was determined by Etest. The number of isolates identified as C. dubliniensis, C. albicans and other yeast species were 71 (4.9%), 862 (59.6%) and 512 (35%) respectively. All the C. dubliniensis isolates originated from respiratory (5.9%) or oral (3.2%) specimens with an overall prevalence of 4.9%, and were found to be susceptible to fluconazole. The isolation of C. dubliniensis from respiratory or oral specimens and not from blood or urine specimens suggests that this species has preference to colonise these sites of human body."

        "Abstract": "Antifungal agents are often prescribed in critically ill patients who are receiving many other medications. When using systemic antifungals, clinicians may possess susceptibility data and they are typically aware of the potential toxicity of these agents. However, the myriad of potential drugs that antifungal agents can interact with is daunting and can be confusing. This article reviews the pharmacokinetic properties of antifungal agents and their clinically relevant drug interactions. The antifungal agents differ markedly in their pharmacokinetic properties and in how they interact with other medicines. The amphotericin B formulations interact with other medicines primarily by reducing their renal elimination or producing additive toxicities. The azoles interact with other medicines primarily by inhibiting biotransformation or by affecting drug distribution and elimination. The echinocandins have the lowest propensity to interact with other medicines. The clinical relevance of antifungal-drug interactions varies substantially. While certain interactions are benign and result in little or no untoward clinical outcomes, others can produce significant toxicity or compromise efficacy if not properly managed through monitoring and dosage adjustment. However, certain interactions produce significant toxicity or compromise efficacy to such an extent that they cannot be managed and the particular combination of antifungal and interacting medicine should be avoided."

It is the most common dermatophyte infection in children under 12 years of age, with a predominance in those of sub-Saharan African descent. Common signs include hair loss, scaling, erythema and impetigo-like plaques. Adults may also be affected, but to a lesser degree. The causative species are from the Microsporum and Trichophyton genera. Limited treatment options and diverse modes of transmission complicate the clinician's ability to address this disease adequately. Although dermatophytes are ubiquitous in our environment and tinea capitis is common, therapeutic options can be utilised to reduce morbidity."

        "Abstract": "Obesity is linked with many deleterious health consequences and is associated with increased risk of chronic disease including type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis and certain forms of cancer. Recent work has highlighted the impact of obesity to activate inflammatory gene networks and suggests a causal function of inflammation in the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome. Since 2005, when Dr Gokhan Hotamisligil chaired the fourth Stock Conference in Istanbul, Turkey, entitled 'Obesity and Inflammation', there has been an explosion of studies investigating the relationship between obesity, inflammation and substrate metabolism. The exuberance surrounding this field of research is exemplified by the body of work that has been published in these past 4 years, including over 1400 publications. During this time, several novel mechanisms relating to cellular inflammation have been uncovered including the role of the hematopoietic system, toll-like receptor activation, endoplasmic reticulum stress and very recently T-cell activation in obesity-induced insulin resistance. These discoveries have led us to rethink cellular nutrient sensing and its role in inflammation and metabolic disease. Despite burgeoning investigation in this field, there still remain a number of unanswered questions. This review that evolved from the 2009 Stock Conference summarizes current research and identifies the deficiencies in our understanding of this topic. The overall goal of this Stock Conference was to bring together leading investigators in the field of inflammation and obesity research in the hope of fostering new ideas, thus advancing the pursuit of novel therapeutic strategies to reduce disease risk and or better treat chronic disease including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer."

There are limited data in children. The goal of this study was to assess lead survival in young patients undergoing ICD implantation at a single center.Methods:Records of patients under 21 years old with transvenous ICD leads implanted at our center from June 1997 to August 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. Age, weight, height, diagnosis, lead and generator model, venous access technique, generator position, pacing thresholds, lead impedance, and R wave size were recorded. \"Lead failure\" was defined as any lead problem requiring surgical intervention to restore proper function to the ICD system.Results:Seventy-one transvenous leads were included (70 patients). Average age at implant was 14.8 years (range 5.7-19.5). All the devices were implanted by a single operator (HMS). Venous access was obtained via cephalic cutdown in 66/71. Mean follow-up time was 2.8 years (range 0.2-7.8 years, median 2.3 years). There were no infections requiring explantation. There were four lead failures. Three were lead fractures, occurring 12, 13, and 19 months after implant. The fourth lead failed when an arrhythmia was not appropriately detected, and a second dedicated rate-sensing lead was thus implanted. Univariate analysis did not identify any variable to be a significant predictor of lead failure. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated 5-year lead survival at 89.6%.Conclusions:ICD lead survival in children, when performed by an experienced operator, is similar to that found in adults."

Here, we show that expression of (V600E)Braf using the tyrosinase promoter leads to an unexpected embryonic lethality, with the animals dying before, at, or shortly after birth. The mice suffer from a range of developmental defects in the skin, the brain, the eyes and the heart, tissues that are normally colonized by melanocytes. We show that the (V600E)Braf expressing cells are potential melanocytic precursors that are fully transformed, suggesting that (V600E)Braf stimulates proliferation and blocks differentiation of these cells. Our data suggests that the presence of these cells in the organs that are normally occupied by melanocytes leads to severe developmental disruption, resulting in catastrophic defects and leading to death of the individual."

Like in many other countries a database with this kind of datasets does not exist in Germany. To establish it, standards have to be set for flood damage data collection. We approached this problem by questioning experts about their information needs for flood damage analysis. This survey is done by applying a Delphi survey approach. The aptitude of the Delphi approach to assess, structure, and standardize expert knowledge is evaluated in this article. In the survey a panel of 55 experts working in the field of flood damage analysis for insurances, engineering companies/consultancy, public water management, and universities and other scientific institutions helped to identify common information needs. The multi-step Delphi method proved to reduce the deviation of answers thereby enabling consensual results and also enhanced the quality by modifying group answers in the direction of experience based answers. There was also a high level of congruence in information needs between experts from different fields of employment that allowed the derivation of common standards."

        "Abstract": "Peanut allergy is a public health concern, owing to the high prevalence in France and the severity of the reactions. Despite peanut-containing product avoidance diets, a risk may exist due to the adventitious presence of peanut allergens in a wide range of food products. Peanut is not mentioned in their ingredients list, but precautionary labeling is often present. A method of quantifying the risk of allergic reactions following the consumption of such products is developed, taking the example of peanut in chocolate tablets. The occurrence of adventitious peanut proteins in chocolate and the dose-response relationship are estimated with a Bayesian approach using available published data. The consumption pattern is described by the French individual consumption survey INCA2. Risk simulations are performed using second-order Monte Carlo simulations, which separately propagates variability and uncertainty of the model input variables. Peanut allergens occur in approximately 36% of the chocolates, leading to a mean exposure level of 0.2 mg of peanut proteins per eating occasion. The estimated risk of reaction averages 0.57% per eating occasion for peanut-allergic adults. The 95% values of the risk stand between 0 and 3.61%, which illustrates the risk variability. The uncertainty, represented by the 95% credible intervals, is concentrated around these risk estimates. Children have similar results. The conclusion is that adventitious peanut allergens induce a risk of reaction for a part of the French peanut-allergic population. The method developed can be generalized to assess the risk due to the consumption of every foodstuff potentially contaminated by allergens."

Stochastic simulations were based on plausible modes of contamination of a pool (literature derived), river (site-specific), and recreational lakes (literature derived). The highest estimated risks of infection were derived from the (highly contaminated) recreational lake scenario, considered the upper end for risk of infection for both children (10 infections per 1,000 swims [5 per thousand: two infections per 1,000 swims; 95 per thousand: three infections per 100 swims]) and adults (four infections per 1,000 swims [5 per thousand: four infections per 1,000 swims; 95 per thousand: one infection per 100 swims]). Simulating the likely Cryptosporidium oocyst concentration in a lane pool that a child would be exposed to following a diarrheal fecal release event resulted in the third highest mean risk of infection (four infections per 10,000 swims [5 per thousand: three infections per 100,000; 95 per thousand: 10 infections per 10,000 swims]). The findings from this study illustrate the need for systematic and standardized research to quantify Cryptosporidium oocyst levels in Canadian public pools and recreational beaches. There is also a need to capture the swimming practices of the Canadian public, including most common forms and frequency measures. The study findings suggest that swimming in natural swim environments and in pools following a recent fecal contamination event pose significant public health risks. When considering these risks relative to other modes of cryptosporidiosis transmission, they are significant."

In the first study, a theory-based monitoring instrument for consumer confidence in the safety of food was developed and validated. The monitoring instrument assesses consumer confidence together with its determinants. Model and measurement invariance were validated rigorously before developments in consumer confidence in the safety of food and its determinants were investigated over time. The results from the longitudinal analysis show that across four waves of annual data collection (2003-2006), the framework was stable and that the relative importance of the determinants of confidence was, generally, constant over time. Some changes were observed regarding the mean ratings on the latent constructs. The second study explored how newspaper coverage of food safety related issues affects consumer confidence in the safety of food through subjective consumer recall of food safety incidents. The results show that the newspaper coverage on food safety issues is positively associated with consumer recall of food safety incidents, both in terms of intensity and recency of media coverage."

Uncertain hazards (natural and engineering) have been successfully analyzed using probabilistic risk analysis (PRA). Unlike uncertain hazards, terrorists and hostile states are intelligent adversaries who can observe our vulnerabilities and dynamically adapt their plans and actions to achieve their objectives. This article compares uncertain hazard risk analysis with intelligent adversary risk analysis, describes the intelligent adversary risk analysis challenges, and presents a probabilistic defender-attacker-defender model to evaluate the baseline risk and the potential risk reduction provided by defender investments. The model includes defender decisions prior to an attack; attacker decisions during the attack; defender actions after an attack; and the uncertainties of attack implementation, detection, and consequences. The risk management model is demonstrated with an illustrative bioterrorism problem with notional data."

        "Abstract": "Background:Blood supplies are delicate resources, particularly vulnerable to incidents affecting the health of donors. The critical impact of a pandemic on the availability of red blood cells (RBCs) has been demonstrated in previous research; however, a detailed estimate of the expected deficit is missing. This has become a priority issue in the face of the current influenza pandemic.Study design and methods:Data from several major blood donation services were used to analyze management of blood supplies in Germany. Routine management of RBCs was extrapolated to epidemic and pandemic situations using computer simulations with a mathematical model that allows for analysis of deficits in blood supplies.Results:Routine management and distribution of RBCs are driven by supply, which has marked fluctuations but does not appear to have seasonality. There seems to be a remarkable elasticity in the demand for RBCs that helps to mitigate minor crises in supply, but this is likely to be overstretched during a severe pandemic.Conclusion:The supply-driven management of RBCs in Germany implies that assessment of severity of shortages due to a pandemic depends on detailed knowledge about the fraction of transfusions that do not allow for postponement. Pandemic preparedness should include criteria for prioritization of transfusions."

        "Abstract": "Keloids are locally aggressive scars that typically invade into healthy surrounding skin and cause both physical and psychosocial distress to the patient. These pathological scars occur following minimal skin trauma after a variety of causes including burns and trauma. Although the pathogenesis of keloid disease is not well understood, it is considered to be the end product of an abnormal healing process. The aim of this review was to investigate the molecular and cellular pathobiology of keloid disease in relation to the normal wound healing process. The molecular aberrances in keloids that correlate with the molecular mechanisms in normal wound healing can be categorized into three groups: (1) extracellular matrix proteins and their degradation, (2) cytokines and growth factors, and (3) apoptotic pathways. With respect to cellular involvements, fibroblasts are the most well-studied cell population. However, it is unclear whether the fibroblast is the causative cell; they are modulated by other cell populations in wound repair, such as keratinocytes and macrophages. This review presents a detailed account of individual phases of the healing process and how they may potentially be implicated in aberrant raised scar formation, which may help in clarifying the mechanisms involved in keloid disease pathogenesis."

        "Abstract": "Dermal fibrosis, or scarring, following surgical incisions, traumatic wounds and burns presents a major clinical burden. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 is a major factor known to stimulate fibroblast proliferation, collagen production, and the differentiation of fibroblast to myofibroblast promoting wound contraction. Furthermore, excessive or prolonged TGF-beta1 has been shown to be associated with scarring. Green tea contains high amounts of polyphenols with the major polyphenolic compound being epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). EGCG has been shown to be anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and may improve wound healing and scarring, though its precise effect on TGF-beta1 remains unclear. This study aimed at determining the effect of EGCG on TGF-beta1 collagen contraction, gene expression and the differentiation of fibroblast to myofibroblast. EGCG appears to affect the role that TGF-beta1 plays in fibroblast populated collagen gel contraction and this seems to be through both myofibroblast differentiation and connective tissue growth factor gene expression and reduces the expression of collagen type I gene regulation."

Primary human corneal fibroblasts were treated with MMC, dexamethasone, or in combination. Morphological changes and cell growth were documented using phase-contrast microscopy and PicoGreen assay, respectively. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by annexin V/propidium iodide staining, whereas viability was tested by the live/dead assay and analyzed by flow cytometry. The relative expression of interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 was investigated with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 expression were documented by Western blot analysis. We found that MMC induced corneal fibroblast elongation, apoptosis, and retarded cell growth, whereas DEX did not significantly alter cell morphology or viability. The combination of DEX and MMC did not induce additional apoptosis and cell death. DEX dose dependently down-regulated basal and MMC-induced interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mRNA expression and protein secretion. DEX attenuated MMC-induced p38 and Jun N-terminal kinases activation and up-regulated expression. These suggested that DEX may inhibit MMC-induced interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 by up-regulating MKP-1 expression, which subsequently deactivated p38 and Jun N-terminal kinases activation. Combined MMC and DEX treatment may facilitate corneal wound healing."

Its cellular composition and density frequently change under various pathological conditions, often contributing to altered extracellular matrix production, tissue viscoelasticity, and voice quality. In this study, cellular changes in the rat mucosa following a unilateral stripping injury were investigated and analyzed semi-quantitatively. Distinctive and sequential changes in cellular morphology, composition, and density were observed in the mucosa post-injury. Cellular recruitment was a major event during the early stage of injury and reached its peak level by day 5 post-injury. Several types of cells, including neutrophil-like cells, epithelial cells, and fibroblast-like cells, were sequentially recruited. The sequential emergence of reactive cell populations following injury and subsequent reconstruction of the mucosa suggests their involvement in vocal fold tissue repair and scar formation processes."

The use of computational models holds the promise to improve our basic approach to understanding the process. By modifying an existing ordinary differential equation model of systemic inflammation to simulate local wound healing, we expect to improve the understanding of the underlying complexities of wound healing and thus allow for the development of novel, targeted therapeutic strategies. The modifications in this local acute wound healing model include: evolution from a systemic model to a local model, the incorporation of fibroblast activity, and the effects of tissue oxygenation. Using these modifications we are able to simulate impaired wound healing in hypoxic wounds with varying levels of contamination. Possible therapeutic targets, such as fibroblast death rate and rate of fibroblast recruitment, have been identified by computational analysis. This model is a step toward constructing an integrative systems biology model of human wound healing."

We investigated to what extent this information was disseminated among laywomen and healthcare providers. Questionnaire studies were conducted twice, in 2002 and 2007, for four groups of laywomen and seven groups of healthcare providers in Japan regarding awareness, folic acid supplements and healthy diets. Awareness among laywomen was less than 20%, except for families who had experience with spina bifida in 2002, and 5 years later only pregnant women showed a significant increase in awareness. Awareness among healthcare providers varied from 12 to 76%, depending on their profession, and this proportion increased in five of the seven groups in 2007. The majority of laywomen obtained their information from mass media, while the majority of healthcare providers received information through media for professionals. Laywomen who used folate supplements and healthcare providers who recommended them were initially fewer than 25 and 37%, respectively. Five years later, however, pregnant women who used folic acid supplements increased from 9.1 to 43.1%. As awareness among non-pregnant laywomen and some healthcare providers is considerably low, information should be presented repeatedly to these groups. The difficulty in getting women to consume folic acid supplements is an argument for the government to require folic acid fortification of grains so that the prevention of neural tube defects can be maximized."

In the present study, we aimed to clarify the development of human olfactory epithelium using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).Methods:The development of human olfactory epithelium was observed in 24 externally normal fetuses, which were formalin-fixed and long-preserved, with a crown-rump length (CRL) of 102-336 mm (gestational week 14-38). The olfactory mucosa in the superior wall of the nasal septum near the choana were dissected and observed under SEM. We examined the number of olfactory vesicles per unit area, diameter of olfactory vesicles, and number and length of cilia on olfactory vesicles.Results:At circa (ca) CRL 100 mm (ca 14 weeks), olfactory epithelium displayed several olfactory vesicles with 1-2 short cilia per unit area. At ca CRL 150 mm (ca 18 weeks), olfactory vesicles were present in small clusters, and cilia were longer. At CRL lager than 225 mm (ca 26 weeks), olfactory vesicles became located separately from each other, while length and number of cilia per olfactory vesicle were further increased.Conclusion:The present findings suggest that fetal olfactory epithelium becomes morphologically almost the same as that in adults in late gestation, much later than previously thought."

In this group, the incidences of segmentation defects, fused ribs, absent lumbar vertebrae and full supernumerary ribs were increased in fetuses. In addition, fusion of the basi- and ex-occipital bones was frequently observed in this group (12.9%). This finding was seen at an incidence of 1.4% in the control group, usually in newborns during the ossification process of the occipital bone. Therefore, the fused basi- and ex-occipital bones were considered to be due to altered ossification, but not to be an abnormality. In summary, immobilization of Jcl:ICR mice during the period of fetal organogenesis induced altered ossification of the occipital bones as well as some abnormalities and supernumerary ribs."

Conventional cytogenetic analysis demonstrated a 92,XXXX karyotype. Transvaginal 2D ultrasound-guided coelocentesis for rapid karyotyping can be proposed to women who are near to miscarriage or in cases where a prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of congenital anomaly is performed at an early stage of development. Genetic analysis can be performed using traditional cytogenetic analysis or can be aided by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).

Persistent cloaca should be considered in any female fetus presenting with hydronephrosis and a large cystic lesion arising from the pelvis as assessed by ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Neither pulmonary hypoplasia nor severe oligohydramnios were found in any of our four cases, and they each had a good prognosis.

Coefficient of determinations, however, differed greatly (Fusarium; R(2) = 0.25, P = 0.029, Microdochium; R(2) = 0.73, P < 0.001). Significant differences between years were observed in the regression slopes for Microdochium. Pathogen DNA quantified in 16 extractions after sampling was highly correlated to results following storage for 1-2 years (R(2) > 0.90). Residual maximum likelihood analysis showed that the least and greatest variance components of the testing procedure were DNA extraction subsampling and PCR assay respectively.Conclusions:Amount of pathogen DNA is a useful estimator of seed batch contamination for Microdochium but not Fusarium seedling blight pathogens. Although reproducible over time, improvements to the testing procedure should focus on repeated PCR amplifications to reduce assay variability.Significance and impact of the study:Replacing plate counts with competitive PCR for determining the severity of seed batch contamination is feasible in areas where Microdochium seedling blight pathogens predominate."

Results showed that two wild-type Cm strains, Chy-1 and ZS-1, did not differ in oxalate degradation in modified potato dextrose broth (mPDB) amended with oxalic acid (OA). Cm could grow in mPDB amended with sodium oxalate (SO-mPDB) at pH 6.5 or with ammonium oxalate (AO-PDB) at pH 6.2, but oxalate degradation was very low; oxalate degradation was greatly enhanced in SO- or AO-mPDB with pH being lowered to 2.8-2.9. Similarly, oxalate degradation was higher than 90% in OA-amended mPDB at pH 4.4 but was reduced to be <22% at pH 7.0. Five carbon sources and three nitrogen sources investigated and nutrients from mycelia and sclerotia of Ss were favorable for the growth of Cm and OA degradation by Cm.Conclusions:Cm can degrade oxalate under acidic pH. Exudates from mycelia or sclerotia of Ss may serve as nutrients for Cm mycelial growth and degradation of oxalate secreted by Ss.Significance and impact of the study:The finding of oxalate degradation laid a foundation for mining-related genes in Cm for engineering plant resistance against Ss. Elucidation of the importance of acidic pH and nutrients from Ss in oxalate degradation by Cm will help to understand the interaction between Cm and Ss."

The strains exhibiting strong immunoregulatory activity in the air pouch also interacted strongly with the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The strain DC412 exerts its effect on the intestine through stimulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)2/TLR4-mediated signalling events leading to secretion of a certain profile of cytokines in which gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 are included. The probiotic Lact. acidophilus NCFB 1748 induces the same cytokine profile in addition to IL-12B, and this response is potentially mediated by the synergy of TLR2 and TLR9.Conclusion:The strain DC412 possesses the in vitro and in vivo characteristics of a probiotic micro-organism.Significance and impact of the study:The dorsal mouse or rat air pouch may be used as an alternative and rapid method for the initial discrimination and selection of potential probiotic Lactobacillus strains."

        "Abstract": "Aims:To assess the impact of reaerosolization from liquid impingement methods on airborne virus sampling.Methods and results:An AGI-30 impinger containing particles [MS2 bacteriophage or 30-nm polystyrene latex (PSL)] of known concentration was operated with sterile air. Reaerosolized particles as a function of sampling flow rate and particle concentration in the impinger collection liquid were characterized using a scanning mobility particle sizer. Reaerosolization from the impinger was also compared to that from a BioSampler. Results show that reaerosolization increases as flow rate increases. While the increased particle concentration in the impinger collection liquid leads to an increase in the reaerosolization of PSL particles, it does not necessarily lead to an increase in the reaerosolization of virus particles. Reaerosolization of virus particles begins to decrease as the particle concentration in the impinger collection liquid rises above 10(6) PFU ml(-1). This phenomenon results from aggregation of viral particles at high concentrations. Compared with micron-sized particles, nanosized virus particles are easier to aerosolize because of reduced inertia. Reaerosolization from the BioSampler is demonstrated to be significantly less than that from the impinger.Conclusions:Reaerosolization from impingement sampling methods is a mode of loss in airborne virus sampling, although it is not as significant a limitation as the primary particle size of the aerosol. Utilizing a BioSampler coupled with short sampling periods to prevent high accumulative concentrations can minimize the impact of reaerosolization.Significance and impact of the study:This study confirms reaerosolization of virus particles to be a mode of loss in impingement sampling and identifies methods to minimize the loss."

Experimental groups were Britesmile + Light (BL) (15% hydrogen peroxide + plasm arc; 4 x 20 minutes), Britesmile + No Light (BN) (BL, no light), Pola office + Light (PL) (35% hydrogen peroxide + LED; 4 x 8 minutes), and Pola office + No light (PN) (PL, no light). Color changes (DeltaE) and the CIELAB (Commission Internationale de l' Eclairage, L* a* b* color system) parameters (L*, a*, and b*) were assessed with a spectrophotometer before (B), immediately (A), 1 day and 7 days after bleaching. The microhardness was measured before (B) and after (A), the obtained data were submitted to a two-way analysis of variance, and DeltaE were submitted to t-test for each period. Only Pola Office, in which the peroxide is associated with the light, improved DeltaE when evaluated immediately after bleaching (p < 0.001). Light exposure did not influence DeltaE after 1 day or 7 days for either bleaching system. The enamel microhardness was not altered after bleaching for BriteSmile. However, enamel microhardness was reduced after bleaching for Pola Office, 283 MPa (+/-21) and 265 MPa (+/-27), respectively. It was concluded that these two bleaching systems were efficient regardless of the light systems used. However, the 35% hydrogen peroxide altered the enamel microhardness. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Enamel microhardness was affected by a 35% hydrogen peroxide in-office bleaching therapy. Moreover, the in-office bleaching outcome was not improved by using the light associated with systems tested in this study. (J Esthet Restor Dent 21:387-396, 2009)."

They were separated into four groups for the application of the surface sealants, and a control group (without surface sealing). Thermal cycling with baths of 5 degrees C +/- 2 degrees C and 55 degrees C +/- 2 degrees C were performed in 600 cycles. The teeth were made impermeable, except for a 3-mm window around the restoration and immersed in a 50% silver nitrate solution for 8 hours. The crown was sectioned longitudinally and the cuts were analyzed by three independent evaluators, using a stereoscopic loupe with 10x magnification that attributed representative scores. Agreement among the examiners was evaluated by the Kappa test.Results:The Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn Method showed that there was significant difference between the Control and Seal & Protect groups. The Seal & Protect group presented the lowest degree of microleakage, followed by the Optiguard and Xeno III groups. The highest scores were obtained in the Control group.Conclusion:The sealant materials evaluated presented different rates of effectiveness, and Seal & Protect was the most effective in decreasing the degree of marginal microleakage. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Although surface sealants or covering agents have been used to diminish microleakage, they may present different rates of effectiveness with regard to reducing the degree of marginal leakage.

The baseline color values were measured with a spectrophotometer. The specimens of each restorative material were randomly divided into two groups (N = 21). While the first group specimens were stored in distilled water (nonbleaching group-control), bleaching agent (Opalescence PF 20% [Ultradent Poducts, South Jordan, UT, USA]) was applied on the top surface of each specimen of the second group (bleaching group). After color change values were measured, the specimens were randomly divided into three subgroups (N = 7) according to the staining solutions. The color change values (DeltaE*ab) were calculated and the data were subjected to analysis of variance. Statistical significance was declared if the p value was 0.05 or less.Results:There was no statistically significant difference within each restorative material's DeltaE*ab values after bleaching (p = 0.714). Also, the staining solutions did not cause a statistically significant difference between DeltaE*ab values of bleaching compared with nonbleaching groups (p = 0.146).

Rhizobia strategies range from mutualistic nitrogen fixers to parasitic nonfixers that hoard plant resources to increase their own survival in soil. Host plants reward beneficial rhizobia with higher nodule growth rates, generating a trade-off between reproduction in nodules and subsequent survival in soil. However, hosts might not discriminate between strains in mixed infections, allowing nonfixing strains to escape sanctions. We construct an adaptive dynamics model of symbiotic nitrogen-fixation and find general situations where symbionts undergo adaptive diversification, but in most situations complete nonfixers do not evolve. Social conflict in mixed infections when symbionts face a survival-reproduction trade-off can drive the origin of some coexisting symbiont strategies, where less mutualistic strains exploit benefits generated by better mutualists."

        "Abstract": "The prevalence of colorectal cancer is increasing in Asia. However, the age-standardized rate has reached a plateau in some countries. Some studies have shown a male predominance difference and increasing risk in the elderly, but not in the younger population. 'Right shifting' of colorectal cancer, not accountable by difference in age or the indications for endoscopic examination, has also been noted. Westernized diet is associated with colorectal cancer, but controversy remains on how it causes colorectal cancer. Alcohol consumption, obesity, diabetes mellitus, consumption of red and processed meat and cigarette smoking are linked to bowel cancer epidemiologically. Only high dietary calcium has a consistent negative (or 'protective') effect. The efficacy of fish oil, vitamin D, soy, phytoestrogens, folate, methionine, riboflavin and vitamin B6 has not been established. Aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use decrease risk of colorectal cancer after 5-10 years of use. There is no evidence for a detrimental effect of proton pump inhibitors or benefit of statins in colorectal cancer. In conclusion, there is a rising trend and prevalence of colorectal cancer in Asia. Dietary modification or supplementation may not be effective in preventing colorectal cancer. Surveillance of colorectal cancer in high-risk groups, according to current recommendation, is probably most effective."

        "Abstract": "There have been innumerable studies published in the attempt to identify gene expression signatures in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). When all the regulators and targets of the differentially expressed genes are analyzed from larger studies, the most striking theme is upregulation of mitosis-promoting and cell proliferation genes in HCC compared with 'liver-specific gene clusters' in non-tumorous tissue. A major limitation of expression profiling is that it only provides a 'snapshot' of what is an evolving process and thus cannot distinguish the differences in gene expression that are primary effectors of dysregulated growth from those that represent downstream consequences. The development of HCC in a chronically diseased liver, often referred to as hepatocarcinogenesis, is a multistep process characterized by the progressive accumulation and interplay of genetic alterations causing aberrant growth, malignant transformation of liver parenchymal cells, followed by vascular invasion and metastasis. This review will discuss HCC precursor lesions, draw on the 'proliferation cluster' genes highlighted from HCC expression profiling studies, relate them to a selection of regulatory networks important in liver regeneration, cell cycle control and their potential significance in the pathogenesis of HCC or primary liver cancer."

The present study aimed to describe how dietitians and their clients interpret this dialogue and to explore the implications for practice.Methods:A purposive quota sample of dietitians (n = 46) from 21 health services in one state of Australia and a quota of their adult patients (n = 34) were interviewed about dietitians' nutrition education roles. Semi-structured interviews were transcribed and identified themes developed into a questionnaire to survey Australian dietitians. Analysis used frequencies and nonparametric statistics (P <0.05). Triangulation of the results obtained from the studies revealed a strong agreement between data sources.Results:Dietitians' dress attire was perceived as a key source of nonverbal communications by dietetics clients. This was recognised by 75% of the 256 dietitians who were surveyed nationally. Dietitians favoured a professional style (i.e. skirt or slacks, with top). Many clients rejected formal dress (i.e. suit, high heels) as being a potential communication barrier. Some clients viewed dietitians' bodily size/shape as a role model. Implications of dietitians' presentation (i.e. how you look) were important to both clients and dietitians.Conclusion:Dress style is implicated in nonverbal communication dialogues between the dietitian and client. As a matter of competence and to maintain congruency in communication, dietitians should be aware of their clients' preferences for formality of dress, and conduct their attire accordingly."

The present study aimed to evaluate the validity, reliability and acceptability of the Imperial Nutritional Screening System (INSYST); a tool that does not require the BMI.Methods:Patients were screened by the researcher within 72 h of admission using INSYST I & II, Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) and Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), including taking height and weight. Routine INSYST data, completed by nursing staff, were subsequently collected. At risk and malnourished patients were combined for statistical analysis. Inter-tool and inter-rater agreement (kappa, kappa) was evaluated. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Nurses were timed using INSYST. Acceptability, including ease and speed of use, was evaluated.Results:Kappa (agreement) scores (all P < 0.001) were substantial for INSYST I versus MUST and MNA (kappa = 0.73 and kappa = 0.76, respectively) and moderate for INSYST II (both kappa = 0.53). The sensitivity of INSYST I and II was high (95-100%), whereas specificity was lower (65-83%). The agreement between dietitian and nurse for INSYST I was substantial kappa = 0.77 and that for INSYST II was fair kappa = 0.39 (both P <or= 0.001). There was little disagreement for INSYST I, although nurses tended to underestimate malnutrition risk when using INSYST II. INSYST I took a median of 60 s to complete, INSYST II took 102 s and weighing took 100 s, giving a total time of approximately 5 min. Likert scales showed that the majority of nurses scored INSYST as being fast and easy to use.Conclusions:INSYST has shown promising levels of concurrent validity (versus MUST and MNA), inter-rater reliability and acceptability, suggesting that BMI (and therefore height) is unnecessary for identifying malnourished patients."

The aim of this secondary analysis was to determine whether the MST could be a useful nutrition screening tool when compared with a full nutrition assessment by Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) in the residential aged care setting.Methods:Two hundred and eighty-five residents (29% male; mean age 84 +/- 9 years) from eight residential aged care facilities in Australia participated in the study. A secondary analysis of data collected during a nutrition intervention study was conducted. The MST consists of two questions related to recent weight loss and appetite. Although the MST was not specifically applied, weight loss and appetite information was available and an estimated MST score (0-5) was calculated. Nutritional status was assessed by a research assistant trained in using the SGA.Results:Malnutrition prevalence was 42.8% (122 malnourished out of 285 residents). Compared to the SGA, the MST was an effective predictor of nutritional risk (sensitivity = 83.6%, specificity = 65.6%, positive predictive value = 0.65, negative predictive value = 0.84).Conclusions:The components of the MST have acceptable sensitivity and specificity, suggesting that it can play a valuable role in quickly identifying the risk of malnutrition in the residential aged care setting. Further prospective research using the MST tool against a broader array of objective and subjective nutritional parameters is required to confirm its validity as a screening tool in aged care settings."

The present study examines the reported preferences for the provision of nutrition (salt, fat and energy) and ingredient information in six types of UK catering outlets.Methods:Participants completed a short postal survey, assessing their frequency of dining at specific catering establishments as well as their desire to see nutrition and ingredient information.Results:The responses from 786 adults aged >or=18 years (of whom 65% claimed to be 'motivated to eat a healthy diet') indicated that over 40% reported eating at a catering outlet at least once a week. Over half said that they would wish to see information on ingredients and the salt content of menu items at all venues. Preference for information on energy and fat content was less popular and varied in the range 42-56% for energy and 47-59% for fat. It is notable that 43% of respondents said they would welcome information on energy content of menu items in restaurants.Conclusion:A significant proportion of consumers wish to see information on the ingredients and nutrition composition on menu items for sale in UK catering outlets. Such information is likely to raise an awareness and understanding of healthy food choices and assist the population in making informed choices about healthy eating."

At baseline, significant correlations were proved between two- and three-dimensional systems in terms of either reference vessel diameter (R(2)= 0.68 and 0.29 for main and side branches, respectively), minimum lumen diameter (R(2)= 0.73 and 0.36), stenosis diameter (R(2)= 0.69 and 0.29), and lesion length (R(2)= 0.48 and 0.58). These results were consistent with those observed after the procedure and at 8-month follow-up. Lesion length was significantly longer with the three-dimensional compared to the two-dimensional system for both main and side branches (P < 0.001, and P = 0.007, respectively).Conclusions:The three-dimensional quantitative reconstruction system may provide accurate evaluation of the complex curvilinear structure of bifurcation lesions when using a double stent technique."

In the present study, the expression of clock genes (Bmal1, Clock, Cry1, Cry2, Per2 and Per3) in the PMM was determined under short (8 : 16 h light/dark cycle) and long (16 : 8 h light/dark cycle) photoperiods relative to changes associated with the diurnal rhythm of DA and MEL. Constant darkness (0 : 24 h light/dark cycle) was used to assess the endogenous response of clock genes. In addition, light pulses were given at zeitgeber time (ZT) 8, 14 and 20 to ascertain whether clock gene expression is modulated by light pulse stimulation and therefore has a daily phase-related response. In the PMM, the temporal clock gene expression profiles were similar under short and long photoperiods, except that Per3 gene was phase-delayed by approximately 16 h under long photoperiod. In addition, Cry1 and Per3 genes were light-induced at ZT 14, the photosensitive phase for gonad recrudescence, whereas the Clock gene was repressed. Gene expression in established circadian pacemakers, the visual suprachiasmatic nucleus (vSCN) and the pineal, was also determined. Clock genes in the pineal gland were rhythmic under both photoperiods, and were not altered after light pulses at ZT 14, which suggests that pineal clock genes may not be associated with the photosensitive phase and reproductive activities. In the vSCN, clock gene expression was phase-shifted depending on the photoperiod, with apexes at night under short day length and during the day under long day length. Furthermore, light pulses at ZT 14 induced the Per2 gene, whereas it repressed the Bmal1 gene. Taken together, the changes in clock gene expression observed within the PMM were unique compared to the pineal and vSCN, and were induced by long photoperiod and light during the daily photosensitive phase; stimuli that are also documented to promote reproductive activity. These results show that Cry1 and Per3 are involved in the photic response associated with the PMM neuronal activation and are coincident with an essential circadian mechanism (photosensitive phase) controlling the reproductive neuroendocrine system."

It is well established that the stress neuropeptide, corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), has a profound inhibitory action on GnRH pulse generator frequency. Although stress is known to affect the timing of puberty, the role of CRF is unknown. The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that CRF plays a critical role in the timing of puberty. On postnatal day (pnd) 28, female rat pups were chronically implanted with i.c.v. cannulae and received 14 days of administration of either CRF, CRF receptor antagonist (astressin-B) or artificial cerebrospinal fluid via an osmotic mini-pump. A separate group of rats served as nonsurgical controls. As a marker of puberty, rats were monitored for vaginal opening and first vaginal oestrus. Levels of CRF, CRF receptor types 1 and 2 (CRF-R1, CRF-R2) mRNA expression in micropunches of the medial preoptic area (mPOA), hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and arcuate nucleus (ARC) were determined across pubertal development; brain tissue was collected from a naive group of rats on pnd 14, 32, on the day of vaginal opening, and pnd 77 (Adult). Administration of CRF resulted in a delay in the onset of puberty, whereas astressin-B advanced pubertal onset. Additionally, CRF and CRF-R1 mRNA expression was reduced in the mPOA, but not ARC, at puberty. In the PVN, expression of CRF, but not CRF-R1 mRNA, was reduced at the time of puberty. These data support the hypothesis that CRF signalling may play an important role in modulating the timing of puberty in the rat."

We aimed to determine the impact of a change of photoperiod on the size of Kiss neuronal populations found in the preoptic area (POA) and arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the ewe brain. Using immunocytochemistry, we first examined the proportion of neurones expressing Kiss, using HuC/D as a neuronal marker, at different time-points after transition from long days (LD; 16 : 8 h light/dark cycle) to short days (SD; 8 : 16 h light/dark cycle). Luteinising hormone (LH) secretion was measured in ovariectomised oestradiol replaced ewes from the month preceding the transition to SD until the sacrifice of the animals at days 0, 45 and 112 from this photoperiodic transition. High LH levels were only observed in animals killed at day 112. The number of Kiss neurones/mm(2) doubled in the caudal ARC at day 112. The percentage of neurones showing Kiss immunoreactivity increased significantly in both the POA and ARC in the day 112 group. In a second experiment, ewes kept in LD received an i.c.v. injection of colchicine 20 h before sacrifice. Colchicine treatment increased the number and the percentage of neurones with Kiss in both the POA and caudal ARC. The data obtained suggest that the increase in Kiss neurones detected in the POA and caudal ARC after transition to SD stemmed from an increase in Kiss synthesis. This up-regulation of Kiss content under the shorter day condition appears to be a late event within the cascade activated by a longer secretion of melatonin, which is a critical factor in switching gonadotrophin-releasing hormone secretion to a breeding season profile."

Glucose sensing neurones reside in key areas of the brain involved in glucose and energy homeostasis (e.g. ventromedial hypothalamus; VMH). We have recently shown that insulin attenuates the ability of glucose-excited (GE) neurones to sense decreased glucose. We hypothesise that this effect of insulin on VMH GE neurones is impaired during T2DM when insulin signalling is dysfunctional. To test our hypotheses, we used whole cell patch clamp recording techniques to evaluate the effects of insulin on VMH GE neurones in brain slices from wild-type and diabetic (db/db) mice. The effects of decreasing glucose from 2.5 to 0.1 mM on VMH GE neurones were similar in wild-type and db/db mice. However, decreasing glucose from 2.5 to 0.5 mM decreased the action potential frequency, membrane potential and input resistance of VMH GE neurones to a significantly greater extent in db/db versus wild-type mice. Furthermore, insulin (5 nM) blunted the effects of decreased glucose in wild-type, but not db/db mice. These differences in both glucose and insulin sensitivity between wild-type and db/db mice were completely ameliorated by the insulin sensitiser, Compound 2 (300 nM). These data are consistent with our hypothesis that impaired insulin signalling in T2DM sensitises VMH GE neurones to decreased glucose."

To test this generalisation, as well as to emphasise a potential influence of the male gonadal axis on the process of HPA habituation, we compared the effects of two commonly used paradigms of repeated restraint in the rodent: ten daily episodes of 0.5 h of restraint and five daily episodes of 3 h of restraint. Both paradigms produced comparable declines in adrenocorticotrophic hormone and corticosterone between the first and last day of testing. However, marked differences in testosterone levels, as well as corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) expression, occurred between the two stress groups. Plasma testosterone levels remained relatively higher in animals exposed to 0.5 h of restraint compared to 3 h of restraint, whereas forebrain gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) cell counts increased in both groups. AVP mRNA was increased after 3 h, but not after 0.5 h of repeated restraint, in the medial parvicellular paraventricular nucleus and in the posterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), and increased with 0.5 h of repeated restraint in the medial amygdala. CRH mRNA was increased after 3 h, but not after 0.5 h of repeated restraint, in the central amygdala and anterior BST. The data obtained illustrate that, despite comparable declines in HPA responses, the pathways recruited for stress adaptation appear to be distinct between restraint groups. Given the extreme sensitivity of limbic AVP to testosterone, and conversely CRH to circulating glucocorticoids, whether differences in endocrine profiles might explain these neuropeptide differences remains to be seen. Nonetheless, the present study provides several new entry points for testing gonadal influences on stress-specific HPA habituation."

Transcranial Doppler (TCD) emboli monitoring may help to guide the treatment by measuring the frequency of microembolic signals (MES). We report a case of IAS where TCD emboli monitoring proved useful in establishing the mechanism of stroke by being artery-to-artery emboli and guiding therapy based on the frequent symptoms and number of MES."

We performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess muscle wasting in the facial and bulbar muscles in two female MuSK-MG patients, with short duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis and prior to commencement of steroid therapy. The study revealed marked atrophy of temporalis, masseters, and lingual muscles with fatty replacement. MRI evidence of early muscle atrophy in MuSK-MG may indicate that MuSK antibodies per se may predispose to muscle atrophy."

The forehead region is easily accessible to NIRS measurements, whereas the role of the anterior prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the processing of emotion remains to be elucidated.Methods:Initially, using event-related NIRS we examined changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) as an indicator of regional CBF changes, which reflect brain activity directly related to emotions, but not to cognitive operations in the anterior frontal regions, during viewing affective pictures. The event-related potentials (ERPs), systemic blood pressure, and pulse rate were also measured simultaneously.Results:The event-related analysis of changes in oxy-Hb for a 6 s-picture presentation period showed that very unpleasant emotion was accompanied by an increase in oxy-Hb in the bilateral ventrolateral PFCs, while very pleasant emotion was accompanied by a decrease in oxy-Hb in the left dorsolateral PFC. There were no significant differences in either ERPs or autonomic nervous system activities between the two emotional states.Conclusion:These findings suggest the possibility of recognizing patients' emotions from CBF changes."

Clinicians may fail to recognize the extraparenchymal disease because they do not consider the diagnosis.Methods:to analyze neuroimaging and clinical characteristics of extraparenchymal NCC, we retrospectively reviewed all such cases presenting to a major general medical school hospital in the State of New Mexico.Results:eleven (30%) of our 37 cases of NCC diagnosed using standard criteria from 1998 through 2004 had extraparenchymal disease. On neuroimaging, 36% of the patients lacked parenchymal cysts, 64% had intraventricular cysticerci, 64% had subarachnoid cysticerci, and 64% had hydrocephalus due to either basal arachnoiditis or direct obstruction of intraventricular pathways. Lumbar puncture was performed in 6 patients. All had a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis, none had CSF or blood eosinophilia, and CSF antibody to NCC could be absent while present in serum. Response to treatment was frequently suboptimal.Conclusions:extraparenchymal NCC is more frequent than previously thought. Because clinicians outside the Southwest United States are often unfamiliar with NCC as a cause of chronic meningitis, chronic ventriculitis, or hydrocephalus without obvious cysts, the diagnosis of extraparenchymal NCC often depends on the correct interpretation of neuroimaging."

Since TCD results may vary among laboratories and sonographers, it requires validation against an imaging modality. We evaluated diagnostic accuracy of TCD performed in our laboratory against time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in detecting intracranial stenosis in patients with acute cerebral ischemia.Methods:Consecutive patients with acute (<24 hours) cerebral ischemia and intracranial arterial stenosis on MRA underwent both TCD and MRA within 5 hours of each other. TCD was performed by credentialed neurosonologists according to standardized protocol. An independent neuroradiologist interpreting MRA was blinded to TCD findings. We evaluated TCD peak systolic velocities (PSV) in proximal intracranial arteries as predictive of moderate (>50%) and severe (>70%) stenosis on TOF-MRA.Results:One hundred and fifty patients (74% males; mean age 53 years) underwent neurovascular evaluation with TCD and MRA. Twenty-two (14.6%) patients were excluded due to absent temporal acoustic windows. Middle cerebral artery TCD PSV values of >140 cm/s and >180 cm/s were found to predict a >50% and >70% focal stenosis, respectively. Optimal cut-off PSV values for other major proximal intracranial arteries were also established.Conclusions:TCD performed in our laboratory shows satisfactory agreement with TOF-MRA in diagnosis and grading of proximal intracranial stenosis in patients with acute cerebral ischemia."

After endodontic treatment and standardized root canal relief at 10 mm, specimens were embedded in polystyrene resin, and the periodontal ligament was simulated with polyether impression material. The specimens were randomly divided into four groups (n = 10), and restored with Cu-Al cast dowel-and-cores cemented with one of four options: conventional glass ionomer cement (GI); resin-modified glass ionomer cement (GR); dual-cure resin cement (RC); or zinc-phosphate cement (ZP). Sequentially, fracture resistance of the specimens was tested with a tangential load at a 135 degrees angle with a 0.5 mm/min crosshead speed. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Fisher test. Two-dimensional finite element analysis (2D-FEA) was then performed with representative models of each group simulating a 100 microm cement layer. Results were analyzed based on von Mises stress distribution criteria.Results:The mean fracture resistance values were (in N): RC, 838.2 +/- 135.9; GI, 772.4 +/- 169.8; GR, 613.4 +/- 157.5; ZP, 643.6 +/- 106.7. FEA revealed that RC and GR presented lower stress values than ZP and GI. The higher stress concentration was coincident with more catastrophic failures, and consequently, with lower fracture resistance values.Conclusions:The type of cement influenced fracture resistance, failure mode, and stress distribution on teeth restored with cast dowel-and-cores."

The manufacturers claim that acetal resin has superior physical properties when compared to conventional denture base acrylic resins. Limited information is available about transverse strengths of acetal resin. The purpose of this investigation was to compare transverse strengths of pink and white acetal resins to transverse strengths of conventional heat-polymerized polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) resin in increasing durations of water storage.Materials and methods:A transverse strength test was performed in accordance with International Standards Organization (ISO) specification No 1567. Twenty 65 x 10 x 2.5 mm(3) specimens of each resin were prepared; five specimens of each resin group were subjected to three-point bending test after 50 hours, 30 days, 60 days, and 180 days of water storage in distilled water at 37 degrees C. Experimental groups' transverse strengths were compared by three-way ANOVA and Duncan's multiple range tests.Results:Transverse strength of PMMA denture base material was found to be in accordance with the requirements of ISO specification No 1567. Transverse strengths of white and pink acetal resin could not be calculated in this study, as white and pink acetal resin specimens did not break at the maximum applied force in the three-point bending test. Flexural strength of acetal resin was found to be within the ISO specification limits. As the water storage time increased, the deflection values of PMMA showed no significant difference (p > 0.05). Both the white and pink acetal resin showed significant increase in deflection as the water storage time was increased from 50 hours to 180 days (p < 0.05).Conclusion:The results of this study indicated that transverse strength values of PMMA were within the ISO specification limit. Water storage time (50 hours, 30, 60, and 180 days) had no statistically significant effect on the transverse strength and deflection of PMMA. Acetal resin suffered from permanent deformation, but did not break in the three-point bending test. Acetal resin showed significant increase in deflection as the water storage time was increased from 50 hours to 180 days. All materials tested demonstrated deflection values in compliance with ISO specification No 1567."

W. E. Walker had introduced adjustable condylar guides, George Snow, the facebow, and Carl Christensen, a method for clinically measuring the condylar inclines. Nevertheless, the average practicing dentist was still using simple hinge articulators and was apathetic to the deplorable state of the artificial teeth available; however, this was all going to change dramatically when two dentists, Alfred Gysi and J. Leon Williams, working together between 1910 and 1914, presented to the profession the \"Trubyte Artificial Tooth System\" that embodied both a typal system for selecting anterior teeth and new posterior occlusal carvings that made possible, for the first time, the articulation of artificial teeth. This incited many of prosthetic dentistry's elite to introduce their own theories of mandibular movement and the articulators that they designed to reflect those theories. The intense debates that ensued, both in the meeting halls and in the literature, were numerous and lasted for decades. At the time, the \"Articulator Wars\" had both positive and negative consequences. Today, with many of the \"Articulator Wars\" issues remaining as part of the practice of dentistry, the \"Articulator Wars\" can be considered a phenomenon of enlightenment."

Results of this survey will enhance scientific knowledge, generate research study ideas, and possibly lead to production of alternative or new maxillofacial materials.Material and methods:A 47-question survey was delivered via e-mail to all members (combined total of 260 members) of the American Anaplastology Association (AAA) and American Academy of Maxillofacial Prosthetics (AAMP) for evaluation of personal preference involving maxillofacial prosthetic materials (intrinsic/extrinsic silicone elastomers and pigments/colorants used, polymerization/curing process, advantages and disadvantages of the most often used materials, most important characteristic of material/technique used).Results:The views of 43 (16%) respondents indicated that the majority surveyed were using room temperature-vulcanized (RTV) silicone products. Silicone pigments for intrinsic and silicone pastes for extrinsic coloring were favored over artist's oil colors and dry earth pigments. The polymerization process and/or curing times and temperatures for the same silicone material varied between users. The top five advantages of most often used materials were good esthetics, ease of coloring, easy manipulation, thin margins possible, and adhesive compatibility. The top five disadvantages were discoloration over time, technique-sensitivity, lack of repairability, extrinsic colors peel/fade, and lack of longevity. Nontoxic/nonallergenic materials with high edge strength and color stability were the most important features when choosing a maxillofacial prosthetic material/technique.Conclusions:The responses to this survey indicate that the majority of AAA and AAMP members are using or have used a variety of RTV silicones, pigments, and colorants in the quest to provide the best possible facial prosthetic service. Further research is needed to further refine and improve extraoral maxillofacial materials/techniques based on the results of this study."

The research was conducted in a laboratory setting and generalizability analysis was used as a statistical technique to identify the sources contributing to variation in the judgment outcome.Materials and methods:A crown was seated on an ivorine tooth in a device that permitted continuous adjustment in intervals of 25 mum to produce known marginal gaps ranging from zero to 250 microm. Forty-nine students and six faculty members used five types of explorers each to determine, by tactile examination, the point on the controlled increasing marginal gap where they would no longer regard the gap as clinically acceptable.Results:There were no differences across type of explorer. Operators with clinical experience had a threshold that rejected crowns at a smaller gap than did those operators without clinical experience (p= 0.007). Faculty members maintained a higher individual degree of consistency in their personal judgments than did students (p= 0.02); however, the inter-operator consistency was significantly lower for faculty members than for students (p < 0.05).Conclusions:Differences among operators in a simulation of the decision regarding gaps in crowns accounted for 63% of the variance; type of explorer used in assisting this decision accounted for about half as much variance. Faculty members making such judgments exhibited high intra-operator consistency but significantly lower inter-operator consistency than did students. The study suggests that the internal standards dentists use for clinical decision making deserves further study as they may be as significant as the equipment used."

Five specimens from each test material (heat-polymerized, chemically polymerized, injection-molded acrylic resin, soft denture reliner) were stored in each solution in 37 degrees C in a dark environment. Colorimetric measurements were done on the 1st, 7th, and 30th days. Color differences among specimens immersed in saliva (control group), and staining solutions were evaluated over time. Data were statistically analyzed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (alpha= 0.05). ANOVA was followed by Tukey test to find which groups differed from each other.Results:Significant color shifts occurred in heat-polymerized and injection-molded acrylic resins in coffee and in soft liner in nicotine over time (p < 0.05) (DeltaE > 1). The color shift of soft liner in nicotine was significantly different than that of the remainder of the test materials in nicotine (p < 0.05). The color shift magnitudes of each test material in coffee and tea were not significantly different when compared among the test material groups (p > 0.05).Conclusions:The effect of staining solutions on the color of each test material in each session was perceivable by the human eye (DeltaE > 1); however, the color shifts of all test materials were clinically acceptable (DeltaE < 3.7) except for soft liner in nicotine, which was not clinically acceptable over time. Therefore, minimizing drinking of such beverages and use of tobacco, particularly when soft liner is applied, may be advantageous for denture wearers for long-term color stability."

After casting, the plates were sandblasted with aluminum oxide (100 microm) and randomly divided into eight groups (n = 6). Each surface to be bonded was treated with one of eight cementing systems. Three resin cement cylinders (0.5 mm high, 0.75 mm diameter) were built on each bonded metal alloy surface, using a Tygon tubing mold. After water storage for 24 hours, specimens were subjected to micro-shear testing. Data were statistically analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey's studentized range test.Results:The application of Metal Primer II resulted in a significantly higher bond strength for LinkMax resin cement when applied in both metal alloys. In general, the cementing systems had higher bond strengths in Co-Cr alloy than in Ni-Cr.Conclusions:The use of AP between alloy metal surfaces and resin cements did not increase the bond strength for most cementing systems evaluated."

        "Abstract": "Background:Oral spindle cell carcinoma (SpCC) is a rare variant of oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The aims of this study were to compare the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features of oral SpCC with conventional oral SCC.Methods:Five cases of oral SpCC and 10 cases of oral SCC (five well-differentiated and five poorly differentiated) were evaluated through conventional hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical reactions to cytokeratins (CK), vimentin, desmin, smooth muscle actin, muscle-specific actin, S-100 protein, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), p53, and ki-67.Results:Oral SpCC showed predilection for males on their sixth decade of life, presenting clinically as painful infiltrative ulcers or ulcerated exophytic polypoid masses, preferably located on the alveolar mucosa. Mesenchymal markers were expressed in the spindle cell but not in the carcinomatous component of SpCC, and it was negative in all SCC. CKs AE1/AE3, 6, 14, and EMA were positive on both carcinomatous and spindle cell components of most SpCCs. These tumors also presented higher p53 and ki-67 expression and no CK 1 expression in contrast to well-differentiated SCC.Conclusion:Oral SpCC presented a different clinical profile than conventional SCC and histopathologic features and p53 and ki-67 expression closer to poorly differentiated SCC. Besides mesenchymal markers, CK AE1/AE3, 6, 14, and EMA expression on spindle cells may be useful as an adjunct on microscopical differential diagnosis of SpCC."

The following information was recorded: route of HIV transmission, total lymphocyte cell counts, weight, smoking habit, alcohol consumption, medications, presence of denture, plaque index, and presence of oral lesions. The association between mode of HIV transmission and the risk of oral lesions among the subjects was determined by multiple logistic regression analysis.Results:Oral lesions were found in 138 HIV-infected heterosexuals (75%) and in 37 HIV-infected IVDUs (46%). Oral candidiasis (OC) was the most common lesion among both groups (44% vs. 28%), followed by hairy leukoplakia (HL) (33% vs. 10%). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between mode of HIV transmission and the risk of oral lesions after controlling for the total lymphocyte cell counts and other confounding factors [OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.5-6.4; P = 0.002]. OC was significantly associated with heterosexual route of HIV transmission [OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.2-4.7; P = 0.014]. Similar association was also observed with HL [OR 3.7; 95% CI 1.5-9.1; P = 0.004].Conclusions:Mode of HIV transmission is associated with the risk of oral lesions in HIV-infected subjects in Thailand. Further studies should be performed to determine if the risk of oral lesions is associated with differences in HIV-subtypes."

Health issues related to higher than normal levels have received much public attention because of their relationship to incidence of heart disease, whereas implications of decreased cholesterol levels remain unclear. Present study tried to evaluate and correlate the decreased cholesterol levels in Oral cancer, Oral precancer and in tobacco abuse.Methods:Total Cholesterol (TC), High Density Lipoproteins (HDL), Very Low Density Lipoproteins (VLDL), Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL) and Triglyceride (Tri) were estimated in 210 subjects. Out of these 210 subjects, 70 subjects were histopathologically confirmed Oral Cancer, 70 subjects were histopathologically confirmed Oral precancer (OPC) and 70, age and sex matched, healthy subjects who are not having Oral Cancer, Oral precancer and who had no history of any major illness in the past. These groups were subdivided into: Subjects with No Habit of Tobacco (NHT) and Subjects With Habit of Tobacco (WHT).Results:There was significant decrease in TC, HDL, VLDL, and triglyceride in Oral Cancer group; and significant decrease in TC, and HDL in Oral precancer group as compared to Control. Mean serum lipid profile levels were not significantly different in subjects between NHT and WHT.Conclusions:There is an inverse relationship between serum lipid profile and Oral Cancer and Oral precancer. There was no overall significant correlation of serum lipid profile with tobacco abuse."

Despite the fact that anaesthetic agents in major surgery were employed during the third century, Chinese surgery is conspicuous by its stagnation. Reverence for the dead, filial piety, abhorrence of shedding blood and other conservative attitudes make it impossible for any accurate knowledge of the human anatomy and physiology, without which surgery cannot progress. This article surveys some highlights in the history of surgery in ancient China and examines the factors responsible for its decline. The second concluding part deals with orthopaedics."

Like every pioneering treatment option, FA faces both the clinicians' and public opinion with a huge amount of medical and psychosocial dilemmas, which, in order to introduce FA as a scientifically and socially accepted procedure into clinical practice, need to be discussed, answered and solved.Methods:This review is based on a detailed literature research in all relevant databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, specialist textbooks), however, recent papers (published between 2006 and 2008) were given highest priority for inclusion.Results:In this review, two main limitations associated with facial tissue allotransplantation, that is, shortage of donations and life-long need for immunosuppressive treatment, are discussed and presented in both psychosocial and medical terms.Conclusion:Although both of these limitations potentially could successfully inhibit the transformation of FA from an experimental therapy to the treatment of choice for patients with severe functional facial impairment, recent literature suggest that FA will find a meaningful place in facial reconstructive surgery."

This study aims to identify (i) the number of admissions because of falls from mango trees; (ii) epidemiology; (iii) seasonal trend; (iv) injury profile; and (v) hospital care provided.Methods:Retrospective case review on all mango tree falls related injuries resulting in admissions at the Lautoka Hospital, Fiji during a 1-year period (2007). Patient records were analysed to identify specific injury patterns such as upper/lower limb fractures, spinal cord injury and head injury, caused by mango tree falls.Results:Thirty-nine cases were identified. Eighty-two percent (n = 32) of the falls occurred in the mango season (June-November). Seventy-two percent (n = 28) of the patients were males and 28% (n = 11) were females. Seventy-six percent were aged 5-13 and only 21% were adults. Also, 77% (n = 30) of the patients were ethnic Fijians and 23% (n = 9) were Fijian-Indians. Sixty-four percent (n = 25) had closed fractures and 17% (n = 7) had open fractures. Fifty-six percent (n = 22) of the fractures were of the fore arm. There were two cases of spinal cord injury, four cases of head injury, one ICU admission and one death. Average hospital stay was 7.56 days.Conclusion:All these injuries were recreational and the majority in the urban setting. They were all avoidable."

Cultures were taken with and without standard Smith & Nephew surgical masks, in positions directly in front and to the sides of a masked registrar. The process was repeated three times for each registrar. A control plate was left exposed to the atmosphere. A control plate and sneeze plate was cultured on blood agar. Three masks were subsequently swabbed to exclude contamination from the masks.Results:2/24 (8.33%) of the side with mask cultures returned significant bacterial growths. Also, 1/12 (8.33%) of the front with mask cultures returned significant growths. In addition, 9/12 (75%) of the direct sneezes resulted in significant bacterial counts. The control plate failed to return any growth. Subsequent culture of the exterior of three surgical masks failed to yield significant growth. There was a statistically significant odds ratio of 0.03 comparing the front and side group with the unmasked direct group. There was no statistically significant difference comparing front and side sneeze growth.Conclusions:While the use of surgical face masks significantly reduces bacterial counts following a sneeze, it fails to eliminate the potential for surgical field contamination completely. The fact that significant bacterial counts can be returned from direct culture through a mask and to the sides of a mask suggests that head position is irrelevant and contamination is possible in any direction. It is, therefore, suggested that, if possible, a sneezing surgeon distances himself/herself as much as possible from the sterile field. We also recommend following a sneeze; surgeons should re-gown and glove, given the risk of contamination of the sterile field.Level of evidence:Level II."

        "Abstract": "Background:Cadaveric research has widely influenced our understanding of clinical anatomy. However, while many soft-tissue structures remain quiescent after death, other tissues, such as viscera, undergo structural and functional changes that may influence their use in predicting living anatomy. In particular, our understanding of vascular anatomy has been based upon cadaveric studies, in which vascular tone and flow do not match the living situation.Methods:An angiographic analysis of the abdominal wall vasculature was performed using plain film and computed tomography angiography in 60 cadaveric hemi-abdominal walls (from 31 cadavers) and 140 living hemi-abdominal walls (in 70 patients). The deep inferior epigastric artery (DIEA) and all of its perforating branches larger than 0.5 mm were analysed for number, calibre and location.Results:Both large, named vessels and small calibre vessels show marked differences between living anatomy and cadaveric specimens. The DIEA was of larger diameter (4.2 mm versus 3.1 mm, P < 0.01) and had more detectable branches in the cadaveric specimens. Perforators were of greater calibre (diameter 1.5 mm versus 0.8 mm, P < 0.01) and were more plentiful (16 versus 6, P < 0.01) in cadaveric specimens. However, the location of individual vessels was similar.Conclusions:Cadaveric anatomy displays marked differences to in vivo anatomy, with the absence of living vascular dynamics affecting vessel diameters in cadaveric specimens. Blood vessels are of greater measurable calibre in cadaveric specimens than in the living. Consequently, cadaveric anatomy should be interpreted with consideration of post-mortem changes, while living anatomical studies, particularly with the use of imaging technologies, should be embraced in anatomical research."

Educated in Edinburgh, he moved to Glasgow, and described and named sympathetic ophthalmia before the time of the ophthalmoscope, well defining his powers of observation and deduction. Founding the Glasgow Eye Infirmary, his 'Practical Treatise on Diseases of the Eye' appeared in English in four editions (1850-1884) and in French and German. In this also appears the first full and clear account of glaucoma. Both he and the illustrator of his book, Wharton Jones, moved to Glasgow because of rather indefinite connections with Robert Knox, the anatomist, who was allegedly helped by the bodysnatchers, Burke and Hare. Mackenzie and his book were highly regarded before the revolutionary ophthalmoscope. He was knighted and appointed Surgeon Oculist to the Queen in Scotland."
