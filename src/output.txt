Abstract: One of the most frequent hereditary causes of thrombophilia is, without a doubt, resistance to Activated Protein C (APC-resistance), which is a consequence of point mutation in gene coding for coagulation Factor V (Factor V Leiden) in 90-95% of cases. The aim of this paper was to determine prevalence of APC-resistance in a group of healthy blood donors. The size of the group is quite representative of Kosovo Albanians. A total of 944 blood donors were examined (537 males and 407 females), for whom APC-resistance was determined by functional methods of coagulation using the kit ACTICLOT(R) Protein C Resistance. Method is based on the test of APTT determined twice: first in the presence and second in the absence of activated Protein C (APC). The ratio of these two values constitutes is called Activated Protein C- Sensitivity Ratio (APC-SR). From 944 examined donors, pathologic values of APC-SR (1,3-1,9) were found in 32 persons (3,4% of the total number). The distribution among sexes was 3,35% (18/537) in male and 3,43% (14/407) in female subjects. The mean values of APC-SR (1,64 in male and 1,71 in female subjects) were not significantly different (P = 0,22). Based on these results, we conclude that the prevalence of APC resistance in Albanian population of Kosovo is within the lower limit of prevalence in general population in different countries of European countries, which, according to some authors ranges is from 3 to 7%.

Abstract: Volume density of respiratory organs was studied in vitro in newborn babies at different age of gestation (abort, immature, premature and mature) using stereometric method. The total of 23 cases was subject to this study. The respiratory organs (trachea, lungs) were taken from autopsies of newborn babies exited from different causes. For this purpose the tissues were fixed in formalin (10%) solution, cut serially in 7micro and 10micro slabs. Volume density of the respiratory system was assessed stereometricaly using Universal testing system Weibel M 42. We observed that volume density of epithelia, musculature and glands were proportionally present in the tracheal tissue. Cellular interstitial tissue is consistently increasing and corresponds to the developmental stages of the newborn babies. The density of tracheal ganglions is greater in premature ages of immature and premature newborns (p<0,05). Decreased number of ganglion cells is observed in mature ages (p<0,05). This is caused by intensive ramification of ganglions from serosa to deeper layers of trachea right to epithelium. Medium diameter of tracheal ganglions is greater in mature newborn babies and corresponds to developmental ages of babies.

Title: Role of meconium in the reaction of airways smooth musculature in the newborn with meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS)

Abstract: The role of meconium in the respiratory system was studied in newborns, who died from various causes (250 up to 3000 g of weight). We monitored tracheal rings response to dopamine, serotonin and ethanol in different concentrations (dopamine: 0,05 mg/ml, 0,5 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml; serotonin (5-HT): 10-4, 10-3, 10-2, 10-1 mol/dm3; ethanol: 0,02 ml, 0,5 ml, 1,0 ml; 96%). Tracheal smooth musculature tonus (TSM) was examined in 48 tracheal preparations taken after the newborn exitus due to different reasons. Based on functional researche of isolated preparations of tracheas, it may be concluded that: aspiration of meconium has not changed the response of TSM to dopamine, serotonin and ethanol (p>0,1) in comparison with the control group, which have died due to different lung inflammatory processes (e.g. pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, atelectasis, cerebral hemorrhage). The results suggest that meconium does not potentiate the constricting action of dopamine, serotonin and ethanol in tracheobronchial system. Meconium causes mild relaxation of the TSM through a mechanism that is not intermediated by the products of cyclooxygenases (prostaglandins, prostacyclins) from the tracheal epithelium or proteins. Also, as it seems, the direct activity of many tested acids in the smooth musculature has no significant impact on increase of the airways tonus in MAS syndrome.

Authors: ['N Krishna', 'P K Pal', 'T N Sathyaprabha', 'S J Sriranjini']
Abstract: Objectives:Evaluation of pulmonary function in patients with spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) 1, 2 and 3 without clinical evidence of pulmonary dysfunction.Methods:Thirty patients (F:M = 7:23; age: 35 ± 11.3 years; SCA1 - 13, SCA2 - 9 and SCA3 - 8) without clinical manifestations of respiratory dysfunction and 30 controls underwent pulmonary function tests. The percentage predicted values of forced vital capacity (FVC), volume of air exhaled during first second of FVC (FEV1), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV), actual values of maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures (MIP and MEP in mmHg), and ratios of actual values of FEV1/FVC (%) and FEV1/PEFR (ml/l/min) were analyzed.Results:Compared with controls SCA patients had significant reductions of FVC (71.1 ± 17.5 vs 85.5 ± 18.7; P < 0.01), PEFR (51.5 ± 20.7 vs 77.1 ± 24.9; P < 0.001), MVV (64.4 ± 21.6 vs 97.2 ± 22.7; P < 0.001), MIP (27.7 ± 16.8 vs 50.1 ± 15.1; P < 0.001) and MEP (38.1 ± 18.7 vs 74.7 ± 16.0; P < 0.001), elevation of FEV1/PEFR (10.5 ± 2.8 vs 7.4 ± 2.1; P < 0.001), but no significant change of FEV1 and FEV1/FVC. FEV1/PEFR correlated positively with illness duration and MVV negatively with severity of illness.Conclusions:The present study showed subclinical restrictive type of pulmonary dysfunction in SCA, and possible presence of upper airway obstruction. Chest physiotherapy and breathing exercises should be introduced early in management of SCA.

Title: A review on sex differences in stroke treatment and outcome
Authors: ['B Stegmayr', 'P Appelros', 'A Terént']
Abstract: Background:Beyond epidemiological differences, it has been controversial whether any important sex differences exist in the treatment of stroke. In this review paper, the following areas are covered: thrombolysis, stroke unit care, secondary prevention, surgical treatment, and rehabilitation. Additionally, symptoms at stroke onset, as well as outcome measures, such as death, dependency, stroke recurrence, quality of life, and depression are reviewed.Methods:Search in PubMed, tables-of-contents, review articles, and reference lists after studies that include information about sex differences in stroke care.Results:Ninety papers are included in this review. Women suffer more from cortical and non-traditional symptoms. Men and women benefit equally from thrombolysis and stroke unit care. Women with cardioembolic strokes may benefit more from anticoagulant therapy. Most studies have not found any tendency towards sexism in the choice of treatment. Post-stroke depression and low quality-of-life seem to be more common among women. Mortality rates are higher among men in some studies, while long-term ADL-dependency seems to be more common among women.Conclusions:Sex differences in stroke treatment and outcome are small, with no unequivocal proof of sex discrimination. Women have less favourable functional outcome because of higher age at stroke onset and more severe strokes.

Abstract: Objectives:Peripheral neuropathy has been reported in association with end-stage liver disease, but there is only a limited number of reports on the incidence and features of these neuropathies.Materials and methods:In this study, 83 patients awaiting liver transplantation were evaluated for the presence of peripheral and autonomic neuropathy.Results:Sixty-five percent of the patients had evidence of neuropathy, in agreement with peripheral NCS or cardiovascular autonomic function test. The neuropathy was more frequent in patients with advanced hepatic failure, evaluated with the MELD score. The most frequent abnormalities in nerve conduction studies were sensory-motor neuropathies and sensory neuropathies, with a length-dependent pattern.Conclusion:Peripheral neuropathy and autonomic neuropathy are common in patients with end-stage liver disease with different etiology and correlate with the severity of the liver disease.

Title: Cerebrospinal fluid metabolite and nigrostriatal dopaminergic function in Parkinson's disease
Authors: ['Y Saito', 'K Ishiwata', 'H Mizusawa', 'K Ishibashi', 'S Murayama', 'K Oda', 'K Kanemaru', 'K Ishii']
Abstract: Objectives:To evaluate the association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) homovanillic acid (HVA) concentrations and nigrostriatal dopaminergic function assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with carbon-11-labeled 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyl)-tropane ((11)C-CFT), which can measure the dopamine transporter (DAT) density, in Parkinson's disease (PD).Methods:(11)C-CFT PET scans and CSF examinations were performed on 21 patients with PD, and six patients with non-parkinsonian syndromes (NPS) as a control group.Results:In the PD group, CSF HVA concentrations were significantly correlated with the striatal uptake of (11)C-CFT (r = 0.76, P < 0.01). However, in the NPS group, two indices were within the normal range.Conclusions:In PD, CSF HVA concentrations correlate with nigrostriatal dopaminergic function. Therefore, CSF HVA concentrations may be an additional surrogate marker for estimating the remaining nigrostriatal dopaminergic function in case that DAT imaging is unavailable.

Abstract: Background:In the hippocampi of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, aberrant expression of citrullinated proteins and peptidylarginase 2 (PADI2) has been identified. We explored the functional roles of these proteins by means of detection of serum anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP antibody) in patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT).Methods:Sera were obtained from 42 patients with DAT, 30 patients with other neurological disorders and 42 healthy controls. Gender ratio and age were comparable among the three groups. The level of anti-CCP antibody in sera was examined by ELISA.Findings:Anti-CCP antibody was not found in the 30 patients with other neurological disorders, and only one of the 42 healthy controls (2.4%) was positive. However, surprisingly, anti-CCP antibody was clearly detected in eight of the 42 DAT patients.Interpretation:Anti-CCP antibody appears to be a simple and early serologic biomarker for DAT among dementia patients. Additionally, our data imply that citrullinated proteins accumulated in the astrocytes of AD patients acquire neo-antigenicity, inducing anti-CCP antibody production.
